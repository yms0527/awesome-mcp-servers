# Experiment 1: DOMShell vs Claude in Chrome

## Hypothesis

DOMShell's filesystem-metaphor MCP tools are **as fast or faster** than Claude in Chrome's built-in browser tools for structured web extraction tasks. Both approaches use accessibility-tree representations under the hood — the question is which **tool design** lets the LLM work more efficiently.

## What We're Comparing

| | **Method A: DOMShell** | **Method B: Claude in Chrome (CiC)** |
|---|---|---|
| **Runner** | Claude Desktop — Cowork mode | Claude Desktop — Cowork mode |
| **How it works** | MCP tools with filesystem metaphor: `cd`, `ls`, `find`, `grep`, `text`, `cat`, `read`, `extract_links`, `extract_table`, `submit`, `navigate`, `open` | Built-in browser tools: `read_page`, `find`, `navigate`, `get_page_text`, `computer` (screenshot), `form_input` |
| **Representation** | AX tree mapped to dirs/files | AX tree as structured output + optional screenshots |
| **Navigation model** | `cd` into elements, path resolution (`text main/article/paragraph`), `ls --after/--before` for siblings | ref IDs from `read_page`, direct `navigate` |
| **Content extraction** | `text` (bulk), `extract_links` (links), `extract_table` (tables), `find --meta` (URLs) | `get_page_text` (bulk), `read_page` (structure) |
| **Interaction** | `submit` (atomic form), `click`, `focus` + `type` | `form_input` by ref, `computer` click by coordinate |

**Key difference:** Both use the accessibility tree. DOMShell wraps it in a Unix filesystem metaphor with composable commands (cd/ls/grep/find/text + pipes). Claude in Chrome exposes it as a structured API (read_page/find). The experiment tests which abstraction an LLM navigates more efficiently.

## Tasks

### Phase 1 (R1-R11): Core Extraction — Tasks 1-4

Four tasks testing single-tab extraction and navigation:

**Task 1: Content Extraction (Read-only)** — Extract first paragraph + first 10 body links with titles and URLs from the AI article.

**Task 2: Search + Navigate (Read + Interact)** — Go to wikipedia.org, search "machine learning" using the search box, click the first result, extract first paragraph + "See also" items.

**Task 3: Multi-step Information Gathering (Complex)** — Navigate to the LLM article, extract first 5 models from the table with orgs, follow the first model's link, extract its first paragraph.

**Task 4: Pagination + Comment Extraction (Hacker News)** — Extract stories from HN page 1 and 2, plus top comments.

### Phase 2 (Sprint 3): Multi-tab Automation — Tasks 5-10

Six tasks designed to exercise Sprint 3 automation features (`each`, `for`, `functions`, `call`, `watch`, `script`). These are multi-tab, multi-iteration tasks where Sprint 3 features provide significant call count savings.

**Task 5: Cross-Article Section Comparison** — Open 3 Wikipedia articles, extract h2 headings from all, find common sections. Tests `each` for cross-tab extraction.

**Task 6: See-Also Link Chasing** — Follow 5 "See also" links from the AI article, extract first sentence from each. Tests `for` (bulk open) + `each` (bulk extract).

**Task 7: Page API Discovery** — Discover MediaWiki functions, extract config values, call REST API. Tests `functions` + `eval`.

**Task 8: Article Network Mapping** — Map first-paragraph links from the AI article, extract structured data from all 4 articles. Tests `for` + `each`.

**Task 9: Dynamic Page Monitoring** — Discover and call functions on a demo page, monitor a counter for changes. Tests `functions` + `call` + `watch --until-change`.

**Task 10: Search Pipeline with Replay** — Save a parameterized search script, replay for 3 search terms. Tests `script` (with `$1` substitution) + `for`.

#### Sprint 3 Feature Coverage Matrix

| Feature | T5 | T6 | T7 | T8 | T9 | T10 |
|---------|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:---:|
| `each` | ** | ** | | ** | | |
| `for` | | ** | | ** | | ** |
| `functions` | | | ** | | ** | |
| `call` | | | | | ** | |
| `watch` | | | | | ** | |
| `script` | | | | | | ** |

`**` = primary feature exercised

## Metrics

| Metric | How to Measure |
|--------|---------------|
| **Tool calls** (primary) | Count of tool invocations in the conversation |
| **Correctness (0-3)** | Score against `ground_truth.md` |
| **Completeness** | Items found / items requested (e.g., 8/10) |
| **Hallucination** | Binary: any fabricated URL, title, or content? |

Wall clock time is informative but hard to measure consistently in Cowork (interactive sessions). Tool call count is the primary efficiency metric.

## Prerequisites

### For Both Methods

- Claude Desktop with Cowork mode
- Chrome browser open

### For DOMShell Trials

1. Build the DOMShell extension: `cd ~/repos/DOMShell && npm run build`
2. Load the unpacked extension from `dist/` in Chrome
3. Start the DOMShell MCP server:
   ```bash
   cd ~/repos/DOMShell/mcp-server
   npx tsx index.ts --allow-write --no-confirm --token YOUR_TOKEN
   ```
4. In the DOMShell extension options: set the token, port `9876`, and enable
5. Connect DOMShell to Claude Desktop. In Claude Desktop's MCP settings, add the DOMShell server using `proxy.ts` to bridge stdio to the running HTTP server:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "domshell": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["tsx", "PATH_TO/DOMShell/mcp-server/proxy.ts", "--port", "3001", "--token", "YOUR_TOKEN"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
6. Verify: In a Cowork session, say "Use domshell_tabs to list open tabs." If it returns your Chrome tabs, DOMShell is connected.

### For Claude in Chrome (CiC) Trials

1. Install the Claude in Chrome extension from the Chrome Web Store
2. Connect it to Claude Desktop (it should auto-detect)
3. No MCP server needed — CiC tools are built into Claude Desktop

## How to Run the Experiment

### Running a Single Trial

1. Open a **new Cowork session** in Claude Desktop (clean context — no carryover from previous trials)
2. Copy the exact prompt for that trial from `prompts.md` and paste it
3. Let the agent work — **do NOT intervene** or provide hints
4. When the agent produces its final answer, count the tool calls in the conversation
5. Score the output against `ground_truth.md`
6. Record the metrics

### Trial Order (12 trials total)

Each task is run twice per method (cold + warm). The ordering is counterbalanced so neither method always goes first.

```
Trial 1:  Task 1 — DOMShell            (cold)
Trial 2:  Task 1 — Claude in Chrome     (cold)
Trial 3:  Task 1 — DOMShell            (repeat)
Trial 4:  Task 1 — Claude in Chrome     (repeat)
Trial 5:  Task 2 — Claude in Chrome     (cold, counterbalanced)
Trial 6:  Task 2 — DOMShell            (cold)
Trial 7:  Task 2 — Claude in Chrome     (repeat)
Trial 8:  Task 2 — DOMShell            (repeat)
Trial 9:  Task 3 — DOMShell            (cold)
Trial 10: Task 3 — Claude in Chrome     (cold)
Trial 11: Task 3 — DOMShell            (repeat)
Trial 12: Task 3 — Claude in Chrome     (repeat)
```

### Shortcut: Running All 6 DOMShell Trials in One Session

For practical convenience, all 6 DOMShell trials can be run in a single Cowork session by pasting each prompt sequentially. This means warm trials (3, 8, 11) benefit from conversation context — the agent learns from cold-trial mistakes. This is acceptable as long as CiC trials are treated the same way. Note this in the methodology section of your results.

## Design Constraints

### Guardrails (Built into Prompts)

- **Tool call caps:** 15 (Task 1), 20 (Task 2), 25 (Task 3). If the cap is hit, the agent wraps up with partial results.
- **Max 3 retries per element.** If an element can't be found or clicked after 3 attempts, skip it.
- **No open-ended exploration.** Prompts say "do not explore the page beyond what is needed."
- **No prior knowledge.** Prompts require the agent to actually navigate and read — no reciting from training data.

### Controlling for Bias

- **Same model:** Both methods must use the same Claude model version.
- **Same platform:** Both methods run in Cowork (Claude Desktop), ensuring the same billing path, rate limits, and runtime.
- **Counterbalanced ordering:** Task 2 starts with CiC, not DOMShell, to avoid first-mover bias.
- **Identical task prompts:** The task portion of each prompt is identical across methods — only the tool-constraint preamble differs.
