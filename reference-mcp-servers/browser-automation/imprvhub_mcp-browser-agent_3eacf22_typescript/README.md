## Requirements

- Node.js 16 or higher
- Claude Desktop
- Playwright dependencies

### Browser Support

```bash
npm init playwright@latest
```

This package includes Playwright and the necessary dependencies for running browser automation. When you run `npm install`, the required Playwright dependencies will be installed. The package supports the following browsers:

- Chrome (default)
- Firefox
- Microsoft Edge
- WebKit (Safari engine)

When you first use a browser type, Playwright will automatically install the corresponding browser drivers as needed. You can also install them manually with the following commands:

```
npx playwright install chrome
npx playwright install firefox
npx playwright install webkit
npx playwright install msedge
```

> **Note about Safari**: Playwright doesn't provide direct support for Safari browser. Instead, it uses WebKit, which is the browser engine that powers Safari.
>
> **Note about Edge**: When selecting Edge as the browser type, the agent will actually launch Microsoft Edge (not Chromium). Technically, in Playwright, Edge is launched using the Chromium browser instance with the 'msedge' channel parameter because Microsoft Edge is based on Chromium.
## Installation

### Installing Manually
1. Clone or download this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/imprvhub/mcp-browser-agent
cd mcp-browser-agent
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

3. Build the project:
```
npm run build
```

## Running the MCP Server

There are two ways to run the MCP server:

### Option 1: Running manually

1. Open a terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the server directly:

```
node dist/index.js
```

Keep this terminal window open while using Claude Desktop. The server will run until you close the terminal.

### Option 2: Auto-starting with Claude Desktop (recommended for regular use)

The Claude Desktop can automatically start the MCP server when needed. To set this up:

#### Configuration

The Claude Desktop configuration file is located at:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Edit this file to add the Browser Agent MCP configuration. If the file doesn't exist, create it:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browserAgent": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_DIRECTORY/mcp-browser-agent/dist/index.js",
      "--browser",
      "chrome"
    ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**: Replace `ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_DIRECTORY` with the **complete absolute path** where you installed the MCP
  - macOS/Linux example: `/Users/username/mcp-browser-agent`
  - Windows example: `C:\\Users\\username\\mcp-browser-agent`

If you already have other MCPs configured, simply add the "browserAgent" section inside the "mcpServers" object. Here's an example of a configuration with multiple MCPs:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "otherMcp1": {
      "command": "...",
      "args": ["..."]
    },
    "otherMcp2": {
      "command": "...",
      "args": ["..."]
    },
    "browserAgent": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_DIRECTORY/mcp-browser-agent/dist/index.js",
      "--browser",
      "chrome"
    ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Browser Selection

The MCP Browser Agent supports multiple browser types. By default, it uses Chrome, but you can specify a different browser in several ways:

### Option 1: Configuration File

Create or edit the file `.mcp_browser_agent_config.json` in your home directory:

```json
{
  "browserType": "chrome"
}
```

Supported values for `browserType` are:
- `chrome` - Uses installed Chrome (default)
- `firefox` - Uses Firefox 'Nightly' browser
- `webkit` - Uses WebKit engine (Note: This is not Safari itself but the WebKit rendering engine that powers Safari)
- `edge` - Uses Microsoft Edge

> **Note about Safari**: Playwright doesn't provide direct support for Safari browser. Instead, it uses WebKit, which is the browser engine that powers Safari. The WebKit implementation in Playwright provides similar functionality but is not identical to the Safari browser experience.

### Option 2: Command Line Argument

When starting the MCP server manually, you can specify the browser type:

```
node dist/index.js --browser firefox
```

### Option 3: Environment Variable

Set the `MCP_BROWSER_TYPE` environment variable:

```
MCP_BROWSER_TYPE=firefox node dist/index.js
```

### Option 4: Claude Desktop Configuration

When configuring the MCP in Claude Desktop's `claude_desktop_config.json`, you can specify the browser type:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browserAgent": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_DIRECTORY/mcp-browser-agent/dist/index.js",
        "--browser",
        "chrome"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Technical Implementation

MCP Browser Agent is built on the Model Context Protocol, enabling Claude to interact with a headful browser through Playwright. The implementation consists of four main components:

1. **Server (index.ts)**
   - Initializes the MCP server with Model Context Protocol standard protocol
   - Configures server capabilities for tools and resources
   - Establishes communication with Claude through the stdio transport

2. **Tools Registry (tools.ts)**
   - Defines browser and API tool schemas
   - Specifies parameters, validation rules, and descriptions
   - Registers tools with the MCP server for Claude's discovery

3. **Request Handlers (handlers.ts)**
   - Manages MCP protocol requests for tools and resources
   - Exposes browser logs and screenshots as queryable resources
   - Routes tool execution requests to the appropriate handlers

4. **Executor (executor.ts)**
   - Manages browser and API client lifecycle
   - Implements browser automation functions using Playwright
   - Handles API requests with proper error handling and response parsing
   - Maintains stateful browser session between commands

### Agent Capabilities

Unlike basic integrations, MCP Browser Agent functions as a true AI agent by:

- Maintaining persistent browser state across multiple commands
- Capturing detailed console logs for debugging
- Storing screenshots for reference and review
- Managing complex interaction sequences
- Providing detailed error information for recovery
- Supporting chained operations for complex workflows

## Troubleshooting

### "Server disconnected" error
If you see the error "MCP Browser Agent: Server disconnected" in Claude Desktop:

1. **Verify the server is running**:
   - Open a terminal and manually run `node dist/index.js` from the project directory
   - If the server starts successfully, use Claude while keeping this terminal open

2. **Check your configuration**:
   - Ensure the absolute path in `claude_desktop_config.json` is correct for your system
   - Double-check that you've used double backslashes (`\\`) for Windows paths
   - Verify you're using the complete path from the root of your filesystem

### Browser not appearing
If the browser doesn't launch or you don't see it:

1. **Check if the specified browser is installed**
   - Verify that you have the browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari/WebKit) installed on your system
   - The browser drivers are handled automatically by Playwright

2. **Restart the server and Claude Desktop**
   - Kill any existing node processes that might be running the server
   - Restart Claude Desktop to establish a fresh connection

### Browser process not closing properly
There are known issues with Chromium and Chrome browsers where the process sometimes doesn't terminate properly after use. If you experience this issue:

1. **Manually close the browser process**:
   - **Windows**: Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to open Task Manager, find the Chrome/Chromium process and end it
   - **macOS**: Open Activity Monitor (Applications > Utilities > Activity Monitor), find the Chrome/Chromium process and click the X to terminate it
   - **Linux**: Run `ps aux | grep chrome` or `ps aux | grep chromium` to find the process, then `kill <PID>` to terminate it

2. **Note about browser compatibility**:
   - This issue has been observed primarily with Chromium and Chrome
   - Firefox and Playwright's built-in browser don't typically experience this problem
