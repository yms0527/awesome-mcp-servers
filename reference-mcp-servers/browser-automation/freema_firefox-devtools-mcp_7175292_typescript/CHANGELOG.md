## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed
- Simplified `saveTo` parameter description in screenshot tools to remove opinionated usage instructions that were influencing AI assistant behavior

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **`saveTo` parameter for screenshot tools**: New optional parameter on `screenshot_page` and `screenshot_by_uid` that saves the screenshot to a local file instead of returning base64 image data in the MCP response
  - Solves context window bloat in CLI-based MCP clients (e.g. Claude Code) where large base64 screenshots fill up the context quickly
  - When `saveTo` is provided, returns a lightweight text response with the file path and size
  - Automatically creates parent directories if they don't exist
  - Follows the same pattern as Chrome DevTools MCP's `filePath` parameter

### Changed
- **Screenshot response format**: Without `saveTo`, screenshots are now returned as native MCP `image` content (`{ type: "image" }`) instead of raw base64 text. GUI clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor) render these natively.
- Removed `buildScreenshotResponse` with its token-limit truncation — no longer needed since screenshots are either saved to file or returned as proper image content
- Extended `McpToolResponse` type to support both `text` and `image` content items

## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-04

### Added
- **Enhanced Vue/Livewire/Alpine.js support**: New snapshot options for modern JavaScript frameworks
  - `includeAll` parameter: Include all visible elements without relevance filtering
  - `selector` parameter: Scope snapshot to specific DOM subtree using CSS selector
  - Fixes [#36](https://github.com/freema/firefox-devtools-mcp/issues/36) - DOM filtering problem with Vue and Livewire applications
- **Test fixtures**: Added new HTML fixtures for testing visibility edge cases (`visibility.html`, `selector.html`)

### Changed
- **Improved element relevance detection**:
  - Fixed text content checking to use direct text only (excluding descendants)
  - Added check for interactive descendants to include wrapper elements
  - Implemented "bubble-up" pattern in tree walker to preserve nested interactive elements
  - Elements with `v-*`, `wire:*`, `x-*` attributes and custom components are now properly captured with `includeAll=true`

### Fixed
- **Visibility checking now considers ancestor elements**: Elements inside hidden parents (e.g., `display:none`, `visibility:hidden`) are now correctly excluded from snapshots, even in `includeAll` mode
- **Opacity parsing improved**: Fixed opacity check to properly handle various numeric formats (`0`, `0.0`, `0.00`) by parsing as float instead of string comparison
- **CSS selector error handling**: Invalid CSS selectors now return clear error messages (`"Invalid selector syntax"`) instead of generic `"Unknown error"`
- Interactive elements deeply nested in non-relevant wrapper divs are now correctly captured
- Container elements with large descendant text content no longer incorrectly filtered out
- Custom HTML elements (Vue/Livewire components) are now visible in snapshots with `includeAll=true`

## [0.6.0] - 2025-12-01

Released on npm, see GitHub releases for details.

## [0.5.3] - 2025-01-30

### Added
- Windows-specific integration test runner (`scripts/run-integration-tests-windows.mjs`)
  - Runs integration tests directly via Node.js to avoid vitest fork issues on Windows
  - See [#33](https://github.com/freema/firefox-devtools-mcp/issues/33) for details
- Documentation for Windows integration tests in `docs/ci-and-release.md`
- Branch protection enabled on `main` branch

### Changed
- `.claude/` directory added to `.gitignore`

## [0.5.2] - 2025-01-22

### Added
- New test helper functions for improved integration test stability:
  - `waitForElementInSnapshot()` - actively waits for elements to appear in DOM snapshots
  - `waitForPageLoad()` - ensures page is fully loaded before proceeding
- 14 new comprehensive unit tests for `parseHeaders()` function covering edge cases:
  - Numeric values (direct & BiDi format)
  - Arrays with null/undefined items
  - Nested objects with deep value extraction
  - Circular reference handling
  - Mixed arrays with primitives and objects
  - Boolean values and bytes format
- Global test cleanup system to prevent zombie Firefox processes
- Signal handlers (SIGINT, SIGTERM) for graceful Firefox cleanup on test interruption
- New npm script `test:unit` for running unit tests without Firefox dependencies

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Zombie Firefox processes no longer left running after test failures
  - Added automatic cleanup in `tests/setup.ts` after all tests complete
  - Added process signal handlers to ensure cleanup on Ctrl+C and crashes
  - Prevents port conflicts and resource leaks
- Integration test flakiness caused by race conditions:
  - Form interaction test (hover functionality)
  - Tab snapshot isolation test
  - Network monitoring tests
  - Console capture tests
  - All snapshot tests (7 total)
- Test parallelization conflicts by enforcing sequential execution

### Changed
- Integration tests now run sequentially instead of in parallel to avoid Firefox port conflicts
- Vitest configuration updated with `fileParallelism: false` and `singleFork: true`
- All integration tests refactored to use new helper functions for stability
- Test success rate improved from 95% (with intermittent failures) to 100% consistent success

### CI/CD
- Added Firefox installation step to GitHub Actions CI workflow
- Added unit tests to PR check workflow for faster feedback
- Updated PR checks to include build verification
- Integration tests now run reliably in CI environment

### Test Coverage
- Total tests: 275 (250 unit + 25 integration)
- All tests now pass consistently (100% success rate across multiple runs)
- Enhanced coverage for BiDi header parsing edge cases

## [0.5.1] - 2025-01-21

### Fixed
- Network headers now display actual values instead of `[object Object]`
  - BiDi protocol returns headers as `{ type: "string", value: "..." }` objects

## [0.5.0] - 2025-01-21

### Fixed
- `acceptInsecureCerts` CLI parameter now properly propagates to Firefox

### Changed
- Centralized UID error handling across input/screenshot/snapshot tools

### Removed
- Dead code: `estimateTokens`, `safeguardResponse`, `DEFAULT_HEADLESS`

- Unused utilities: `isExecutable`, `fileExists`

## [0.4.0] - 2025-11-26
