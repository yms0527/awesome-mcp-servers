## MCP Server & Client implementation for using Azure OpenAI

<!-- [![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/mcp-web-auto)](https://smithery.ai/server/mcp-web-auto) -->

- A minimal server/client application implementation utilizing the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Azure OpenAI.

    1. The MCP server is built with `FastMCP`.  
    2. `Playwright` is an an open source, end to end testing framework by Microsoft for testing your modern web applications. 
    3. The MCP response about tools will be converted to the OpenAI function calling format.  
    4. The bridge that converts the MCP server response to the OpenAI function calling format customises the `MCP-LLM Bridge` implementation.
    5. To ensure a stable connection, the server object is passed directly into the bridge. 

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open protocol that enables secure, controlled interactions between AI applications and local or remote resources.

### Configuration

During the development phase in December 2024, the Python project should be initiated with 'uv'. Other dependency management libraries, such as 'pip' and 'poetry', are not yet fully supported by the MCP CLI.

1. Rename `.env.template` to `.env`, then fill in the values in `.env` for Azure OpenAI:

    ```bash
    AZURE_OPEN_AI_ENDPOINT=
    AZURE_OPEN_AI_API_KEY=
    AZURE_OPEN_AI_DEPLOYMENT_MODEL=
    AZURE_OPEN_AI_API_VERSION=
    ```

1. Install `uv` for python library management

    ```bash
    pip install uv
    uv sync
    ```

1. Execute `python chatgui.py`

    - The sample screen shows the client launching a browser to navigate to the URL.

### w.r.t. 'stdio'

`stdio` is a **transport layer** (raw data flow), while **JSON-RPC** is an **application protocol** (structured communication). They are distinct but often used interchangeably, e.g., "JSON-RPC over stdio" in protocols.

### Tool description

```cmd
@self.mcp.tool()
async def playwright_navigate(url: str, timeout=30000, wait_until="load"):
    """Navigate to a URL.""" -> This comment provides a description, which may be used in a mechanism similar to function calling in LLMs.

# Output
Tool(name='playwright_navigate', description='Navigate to a URL.', inputSchema={'properties': {'url': {'title': 'Url', 'type': 'string'}, 'timeout': {'default': 30000, 'title': 'timeout', 'type': 'string'}
```

### Tip: uv

- [features](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/features)

```
uv run: Run a script.
uv venv: Create a new virtual environment. By default, '.venv'.
uv add: Add a dependency to a script
uv remove: Remove a dependency from a script
uv sync: Sync (Install) the project's dependencies with the environment.
```

### Tip

- taskkill command for python.exe

```cmd
taskkill /IM python.exe /F
```
- Visual Code: Python Debugger: Debugging with launch.json will start the debugger using the configuration from .vscode/launch.json.
