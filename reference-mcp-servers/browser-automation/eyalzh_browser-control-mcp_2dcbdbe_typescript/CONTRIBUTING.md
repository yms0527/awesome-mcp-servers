## Development Guidelines

### Testing Requirements
- Make sure to update the Firefox extension unit tests when making changes
- Test the MCP server integration with Claude Desktop
- Test the Firefox extension on Firefox Developer Edition

### Compatibility
- Keep backwards and forward compatibility in mind when making changes
- Ensure changes work across different versions of Firefox and Claude Desktop

### Security and Privacy
Security and privacy are the core design principles of this solution. Please ensure that:
- All browser interactions require explicit user consent
- No sensitive data is logged or transmitted unnecessarily  
- Extension permissions are minimal and justified
