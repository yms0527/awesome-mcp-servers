A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides native integration with Apple Reminders and Calendar on macOS. This server allows you to interact with Apple Reminders and Calendar Events through a standardized interface with comprehensive management capabilities.

## Features

### Core Functionality

- **List Management**: View all reminders and reminder lists with advanced filtering options
- **Reminder Operations**: Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for reminders across lists
- **Rich Content Support**: Complete support for titles, notes, due dates, URLs, and completion status
- **Native macOS Integration**: Direct integration with Apple Reminders using EventKit framework

### Enhanced Reminder Features (v1.3.0)

- **Priority Support**: Set reminder priority (high/medium/low/none) with visual indicators
- **Recurring Reminders**: Create repeating reminders with flexible recurrence rules (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
- **Location-Based Triggers**: Set geofence reminders that trigger when arriving at or leaving a location
- **Tags/Labels**: Organize reminders with custom tags for cross-list categorization and filtering
- **Subtasks/Checklists**: Add checklist items to reminders with progress tracking

### Advanced Features

- **Smart Organization**: Automatic categorization and intelligent filtering by priority, due date, category, or completion status
- **Powerful Search**: Multi-criteria filtering including completion status, due date ranges, tags, and full-text search
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient handling of multiple reminders with optimized data access patterns
- **Permission Management**: Automatic validation and request for required macOS system permissions
- **Flexible Date Handling**: Support for multiple date formats (YYYY-MM-DD, ISO 8601) with timezone awareness
- **Unicode Support**: Full international character support with comprehensive input validation

### Technical Excellence

- **Clean Architecture**: 4-layer architecture following Clean Architecture principles with dependency injection
- **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript coverage with Zod schema validation for runtime type checking
- **High Performance**: Swift-compiled binaries for performance-critical Apple Reminders operations
- **Robust Error Handling**: Consistent error responses with detailed diagnostic information
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction with standardized CRUD operations
- **Functional Programming**: Pure functions with immutable data structures where appropriate

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18 or later**
- **macOS** (required for Apple Reminders integration)
- **Xcode Command Line Tools** (required for compiling Swift code)
- **pnpm** (recommended for package management)

## macOS Permission Requirements (Sonoma 14+ / Sequoia 15)

Apple now separates Reminders and Calendar permissions into _write-only_ and _full-access_ scopes. The Swift bridge declares the following privacy keys so Claude can both read and write data when you approve access:

- `NSRemindersUsageDescription`
- `NSRemindersFullAccessUsageDescription`
- `NSRemindersWriteOnlyAccessUsageDescription`
- `NSCalendarsUsageDescription`
- `NSCalendarsFullAccessUsageDescription`
- `NSCalendarsWriteOnlyAccessUsageDescription`

When the CLI detects a `notDetermined` authorization status it calls `requestFullAccessToReminders` / `requestFullAccessToEvents`, which in turn triggers macOS to show the correct prompt. If the OS ever loses track of permissions, rerun `./check-permissions.sh` to re-open the dialogs.

If a Claude tool call still encounters a permission failure, the Node.js layer automatically runs a minimal AppleScript (`osascript -e 'tell application "Reminders" …'`) to surface the dialog and then retries the Swift CLI once.

### Troubleshooting Calendar Read Errors

If you see `Failed to read calendar events`, verify Calendar is set to **Full Calendar Access**:

- Open `System Settings > Privacy & Security > Calendars`
- Find the app that launches this MCP server (for example Terminal or Claude Desktop)
- Change access to **Full Calendar Access**

You can also re-run `./check-permissions.sh` (it now validates both Reminders and Calendars access).

**Verification command**

```bash
pnpm test -- src/swift/Info.plist.test.ts
```

The test suite ensures all required usage-description strings are present before shipping the binary.

## Quick Start

You can run the server directly using `npx`:

```bash
npx mcp-server-apple-events
```

### Configure Claude Desktop

You need to configure Claude Desktop to recognize the Apple Events MCP server. There are two ways to access the configuration:

#### Option 1: Through Claude Desktop UI

1. Open Claude Desktop app
2. Enable Developer Mode from the top-left menu bar
3. Open Settings and navigate to the Developer Option
4. Click the Edit Config button to open `claude_desktop_config.json`

#### Option 2: Direct File Access

For macOS:

```bash
code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

For Windows:

```bash
code %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

### 2. Add Server Configuration

Add the following configuration to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

**Option A: Using npx (recommended)**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "apple-reminders": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-server-apple-events"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Option B: Using local build**

If you have built the project locally, use node with the path to run.cjs:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "apple-reminders": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/mcp-server-apple-events/bin/run.cjs"]
    }
  }
}
```

For more information on connecting local MCP servers, see the
[official MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/develop/connect-local-servers).

### 3. Restart Claude Desktop

For the changes to take effect:

1. Completely quit Claude Desktop (not just close the window)
2. Start Claude Desktop again
3. Look for the tool icon to verify the Apple Events server is connected

## Usage Examples

Once configured, you can ask Claude to interact with your Apple Reminders. Here are some example prompts:

```

The server will:

- Process your natural language requests
- Interact with Apple's native Reminders app
- Return formatted results to Claude
- Maintain native integration with macOS

## Structured Prompt Library

The server ships with a consolidated prompt registry exposed via the MCP `ListPrompts` and `GetPrompt` endpoints. Each template shares a mission, context inputs, numbered process, constraints, output format, and quality bar so downstream assistants receive predictable scaffolding instead of brittle free-form examples.

- **daily-task-organizer** — optional `today_focus` (what you most want to accomplish today) input produces a same-day execution blueprint that keeps priority work balanced with recovery time. Supports intelligent task clustering, focus block scheduling, automatic reminder list organization, and auto-creates calendar time blocks when many due-today reminders need fixed slots. Quick Win clusters become 15-minute "Focus Sprint — [Outcome]" holds that finish at each reminder's due timestamp, while Standard tasks map to 30-, 45-, or 60-minute events anchored to the same due-time window.
- **smart-reminder-creator** — optional `task_idea` (a short description of what you want to do) generates an optimally scheduled reminder structure.
- **reminder-review-assistant** — optional `review_focus` (e.g., overdue or a list name) to audit and optimize existing reminders.
- **weekly-planning-workflow** — optional `user_ideas` (your thoughts and ideas for what you want to accomplish this week) guides a Monday-through-Sunday reset with time blocks tied to existing lists.

### Design constraints and validation

- Prompts are intentionally constrained to native Apple Reminders capabilities (no third-party automations) and ask for missing context before committing to irreversible actions.
- Shared formatting keeps outputs renderable as Markdown sections or tables without extra parsing glue in client applications.
- Run `pnpm test -- src/server/prompts.test.ts` to assert metadata, schema compatibility, and narrative assembly each time you amend prompt copy.

      "type": "text",
      "text": "Successfully created reminder: Buy groceries"
    }
  ],
  "isError": false
}
```

**Reminder with Enhanced Features**:

When reading reminders, the output includes visual indicators for enhanced features:

- 🔄 - Recurring reminder
- 📍 - Location-based reminder
- 🏷️ - Has tags
- 📋 - Has subtasks

Example output:

```text
- [ ] Buy groceries 🏷️📋
  - List: Shopping
  - ID: reminder-123
  - Priority: high
  - Tags: #shopping #errands
  - Subtasks (1/3):
    - [x] Milk
    - [ ] Eggs
    - [ ] Bread
  - Due: 2024-03-25 18:00:00
```

**Note about URL fields**: The `url` field is fully supported by EventKit API. When you create or update a reminder with a URL parameter, the URL is stored in two places for maximum compatibility:

1. **EventKit URL field**: The URL is stored in the native `url` property (visible in Reminders app detail view via the "i" icon)
2. **Notes field**: The URL is also appended to the notes using a structured format for parsing

**Dual Storage Approach**:

- **URL field**: Stores a single URL for native Reminders app display
- **Notes field**: Stores URLs in a structured format for parsing and multiple URL support

```text
Reminder note content here...

URLs:
- https://example.com
- https://another-url.com
```

This ensures URLs are accessible both in the Reminders app UI and through the API/notes for parsing.

**URL Extraction**: You can extract URLs from reminder notes using regex:

```typescript
// Extract URLs from notes using regex
const urlsRegex = reminder.notes?.match(/https?:\/\/[^\s]+/g) || [];
```

**Benefits of Structured Format**:

- **Consistent parsing**: URLs are always in a predictable location
- **Multiple URL support**: Handle multiple URLs per reminder reliably
- **Clean separation**: Note content and URLs are clearly separated
- **Backward compatible**: Unstructured URLs still detected as fallback

**List Response**:

```json
{
  "reminders": [
    {
      "title": "Buy groceries",
      "list": "Shopping",
      "isCompleted": false,
      "dueDate": "2024-03-25 18:00:00",
      "priority": 1,
      "tags": ["shopping", "errands"],
      "subtasks": [
        { "id": "a1b2c3d4", "title": "Milk", "isCompleted": true },
        { "id": "e5f6g7h8", "title": "Eggs", "isCompleted": false }
      ],
      "subtaskProgress": { "completed": 1, "total": 2, "percentage": 50 },
      "notes": "Don't forget the organic options",
      "url": null
    }
  ],
  "total": 1,
  "filter": {
    "list": "Shopping",
    "showCompleted": false
  }
}
```

## Organization Strategies

The server provides intelligent reminder organization capabilities through four built-in strategies:

### Priority Strategy

Automatically categorizes reminders based on priority keywords:

- **High Priority**: Contains words like "urgent", "important", "critical", "asap"
- **Medium Priority**: Default category for standard reminders
- **Low Priority**: Contains words like "later", "someday", "eventually", "maybe"

### Due Date Strategy

Organizes reminders based on their due dates:

- **Overdue**: Past due dates
- **Today**: Due today
- **Tomorrow**: Due tomorrow
- **This Week**: Due within the current week
- **Next Week**: Due next week
- **Future**: Due beyond next week
- **No Date**: Reminders without due dates

### Category Strategy

Intelligently categorizes reminders by content analysis:

- **Work**: Business, meetings, projects, office, client related
- **Personal**: Home, family, friends, self-care related
- **Shopping**: Buy, store, purchase, groceries related
- **Health**: Doctor, exercise, medical, fitness, workout related
- **Finance**: Bills, payments, bank, budget related
- **Travel**: Trips, flights, hotels, vacation related
- **Education**: Study, learn, courses, books, research related
- **Uncategorized**: Doesn't match any specific category

### Completion Status Strategy

Simple binary organization:

- **Active**: Incomplete reminders
- **Completed**: Finished reminders

### Usage Examples

Organize all reminders by priority:

```text
Organize my reminders by priority
```

Categorize work-related reminders:

```text
Organize reminders from Work list by category
```

Sort overdue items:

```text
Organize overdue reminders by due date
```

## Tags System

Tags provide cross-list categorization for reminders. They are stored in the notes field using the `[#tag]` format, which keeps them human-readable in the native Reminders app.

### Tag Format

Tags are stored at the end of notes:

```text
User notes here...

[#work] [#urgent] [#project-alpha]
```

### Tag Rules

- Tags can contain letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens
- Maximum 50 characters per tag
- Case-sensitive
- Filter by multiple tags uses AND logic (reminder must have ALL specified tags)

### Example Tag Operations

Create with tags:

```json
{
  "action": "create",
  "title": "Review code",
  "tags": ["work", "code-review", "urgent"]
}
```

Filter by tags:

```json
{
  "action": "read",
  "filterTags": ["work", "urgent"]
}
```

Update tags (add/remove):

```json
{
  "action": "update",
  "id": "reminder-123",
  "addTags": ["completed"],
  "removeTags": ["urgent"]
}
```

## Contributing

Contributions welcome! Please read the contributing guidelines first.

## Development

1. Install dependencies with pnpm (keeps the Swift bridge and TypeScript graph in sync):

```bash
pnpm install
```

1. Build the project (TypeScript and Swift binary) before invoking the CLI:

```bash
pnpm build
```

1. Run the full test suite to validate TypeScript, Swift bridge shims, and prompt templates:

```bash
pnpm test
```

1. Lint and format with Biome prior to committing:

```bash
pnpm exec biome check
```

### Launching from nested directories

The CLI entry point includes a project-root fallback, so you can start the server from nested paths (for example `dist/` or editor task runners) without losing access to the bundled Swift binary. The bootstrapper walks up to ten directories to find `package.json`; if you customise the folder layout, keep the manifest reachable within that depth to retain the guarantee.

### Available Scripts

- `pnpm build` - Build the Swift helper binary (required before starting the server)
- `pnpm build:swift` - Build the Swift helper binary only
- `pnpm dev` - TypeScript development mode with file watching via tsx (runtime TS execution)
- `pnpm start` - Start the MCP server over stdio (auto-fallback to runtime TS if no build)
- `pnpm test` - Run the comprehensive Jest test suite
- `pnpm check` - Run Biome formatting and TypeScript type checking
