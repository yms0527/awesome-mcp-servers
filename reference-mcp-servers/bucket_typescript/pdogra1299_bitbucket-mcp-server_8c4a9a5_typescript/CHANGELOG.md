## [2.0.1] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- Republish to restore README display on npm registry page

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-07

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **Merged 8 inverse-operation tool pairs into 4 unified tools** — any client or LLM prompt referencing the old tool names must be updated:

  | Removed (old) | Replacement |
  |---|---|
  | `approve_pull_request` | `set_pr_approval` with `approved: true` |
  | `unapprove_pull_request` | `set_pr_approval` with `approved: false` |
  | `request_changes` | `set_review_status` with `request_changes: true` |
  | `remove_requested_changes` | `set_review_status` with `request_changes: false` |
  | `mark_pr_task_done` | `set_pr_task_status` with `done: true` |
  | `unmark_pr_task_done` | `set_pr_task_status` with `done: false` |
  | `convert_comment_to_task` | `convert_pr_item` with `direction: "to_task"` |
  | `convert_task_to_comment` | `convert_pr_item` with `direction: "to_comment"` |

- **Removed fields from `list_pull_requests` response** — slim list format no longer includes `is_open`, `is_closed`, `api_url`, `description`. Use `get_pull_request` for full details.

- **Removed fields from `list_projects` / `list_repositories` responses** — `id`, `state`, `is_forkable`, `clone_urls` removed (not useful for LLM navigation).

- **Removed fields from commit responses** — `author.email` and `parents[]` removed from `FormattedCommit`. Use `is_merge_commit` boolean (retained) instead of checking `parents.length`.

- **Removed fields from file/directory responses** — `size` removed from `list_directory_content` entries; `size` and `encoding` removed from `get_file_content`; `workspace`, `repository`, `total_files_scanned` removed from `search_files`.

- **Removed fields from diff response** — `message`, `from_hash`, `to_hash` removed from `get_pull_request_diff` structured response.

### Added

- **Tool group filtering via `BITBUCKET_TOOL_GROUPS` environment variable**:
  - Set a comma-separated list of group names to expose only the tools your use case needs
  - Groups: `pr_core`, `pr_comments`, `pr_review`, `pr_tasks`, `commits`, `branches`, `files`, `search`, `discovery`
  - Example: `BITBUCKET_TOOL_GROUPS=pr_core,pr_review,files` exposes only 12 tools (~2,100 tokens) instead of all 29
  - When unset, all applicable tools are exposed (default behaviour)

- **Automatic server-only tool filtering for Bitbucket Cloud**:
  - When connected to Bitbucket Cloud, 10 server-only tools are automatically hidden from the LLM
  - Cloud users see 21 tools instead of 29, saving ~1,100 tokens per request without any configuration
  - Server-only tools: `list_pr_tasks`, `create_pr_task`, `update_pr_task`, `set_pr_task_status`, `delete_pr_task`, `convert_pr_item`, `list_branch_commits`, `search_code`, `search_repositories`, and `search_files`

- **Tool group metadata** on every tool definition (`group` + `availability` fields) for runtime filtering

### Changed

- **Token usage reduced by ~25% (Server) to ~43% (Cloud)** in tool definition payload sent to LLM on every request:
  - Before: 33 tools, ~6,800 tokens
  - After (Server, all groups): 29 tools, ~5,100 tokens
  - After (Cloud, auto-filtered): 21 tools, ~3,900 tokens
  - After (minimal group preset): 12 tools, ~2,100 tokens

- **Shared parameter constants** (`W`, `R`, `PRID`, `BRANCH`, `LIMIT`, `START`, `TASK_ID`) used across all tool definitions to avoid repeating identical parameter descriptions

- **Compressed tool descriptions** — all tool and parameter descriptions trimmed to remove redundant wording while preserving full semantic meaning

- **Author filter in `list_branch_commits`** now matches by `author.name` only (email was removed from `FormattedCommit`)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-01-28

### Added

- **New `search_files` tool for finding files by name or path pattern**:
  - Search for files using glob patterns (e.g., `*.ts`, `**/*Controller*`, `src/**/*.res`)
  - Case-insensitive matching for user-friendly searches (like VS Code's Ctrl+P)
  - Supports searching within specific subdirectories via `path` parameter
  - Branch selection support to search files on any branch
  - Configurable result limit (default: 100) with truncation indicator
  - Returns comprehensive response with:
    - Matched file paths
    - Total files scanned in repository
    - Total matches found
    - Truncation status when results exceed limit
  - Works with both Bitbucket Server and Cloud
  - Uses Bitbucket Server's `/files` endpoint for efficient recursive file listing
  - Client-side glob filtering using `minimatch` library

### Technical Details

- Added `isSearchFilesArgs` type guard for input validation
- Added `handleSearchFiles` method to `FileHandlers` class
- Uses `minimatch` with `matchBase: true` and `nocase: true` options for flexible pattern matching
- Bitbucket Server: Single API call fetches all files recursively
  - Bitbucket Cloud: Uses `/src` endpoint with `max_depth` parameter

## [1.4.1] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- **Pinned `minimatch` to `9.0.5` to avoid `9.0.6` runtime crash for `npx` consumers**
  - Ensures registry installs do not pull the broken `9.0.6` release

## [1.3.0] - 2026-01-25

### Added

- **New `search_repositories` tool (Bitbucket Server only)**:
  - Search for repositories by name or description across all accessible projects

  - Configurable result limit

- **New `decline_pull_request` tool**:
  - Decline/reject a pull request with optional comment
  - Works with both Bitbucket Server and Cloud
  - Fetches current PR version automatically to handle optimistic locking

- **New `delete_comment` tool**:
  - Delete a comment from a pull request
  - Handles version tracking automatically
  - Returns appropriate error for comments with replies (which cannot be deleted)
  - Only comment author, PR author, or repo admin can delete comments

- **New PR Task Management tools (Bitbucket Server only)**:
  - Tasks are checklist items on pull requests (implemented as BLOCKER severity comments)
  - `list_pr_tasks` - List all tasks on a PR with open/resolved summary
  - `create_pr_task` - Create a new task directly on a PR
  - `update_pr_task` - Edit the text of an existing task
  - `mark_pr_task_done` - Mark a task as resolved
  - `unmark_pr_task_done` - Reopen a resolved task
  - `delete_pr_task` - Delete a task from a PR
  - `convert_comment_to_task` - Convert a regular comment to a task
  - `convert_task_to_comment` - Convert a task back to a regular comment

### Changed

- Enhanced `BitbucketServerSearchResult` type to include repository search results
- Added new type guards for all new tools
- Updated README with comprehensive documentation for all new tools

### Technical Details

- Tasks use `severity: "BLOCKER"` for tasks and `severity: "NORMAL"` for regular comments
- Task state can be `OPEN` or `RESOLVED`
- All task operations require version tracking for optimistic locking

## [1.2.3] - 2026-01-20

### Added
- **Structured diff response for `get_pull_request_diff` tool (Bitbucket Server)**:
  - Returns structured JSON with line-by-line information instead of raw unified diff
  - Each line includes `source_line`, `destination_line`, `type` (ADDED/REMOVED/CONTEXT), and `content`
  - Files organized into hunks with start positions and spans
  - Makes it easy for AI tools to add inline comments with correct line numbers
  - Native file path filtering via Bitbucket API (added file path to URL)

### Changed
- **Bitbucket Server now uses JSON API** (`Accept: application/json`) instead of text/plain for diff endpoint
- Response format changed from `{ diff: "raw diff string" }` to structured `{ files: [...] }` format
- Updated tool description to document structured response and line number usage
- Updated README with comprehensive documentation of new response format

### How to Use for Inline Comments
| Line Type | Line Number to Use | `line_type` param |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `ADDED` | `destination_line` | `"ADDED"` |
| `REMOVED` | `source_line` | `"REMOVED"` |
| `CONTEXT` | `destination_line` | `"CONTEXT"` |

### Note
- Bitbucket Cloud continues to use raw diff format (unchanged)
- Glob pattern filtering (`include_patterns`/`exclude_patterns`) still works client-side

## [1.1.3] - 2026-01-08

### Fixed
- **Fixed username encoding for Bitbucket Server participant endpoints**:
  - Usernames containing `+` characters (e.g., `user+1@domain.com`) are now properly converted to slug format
  - Both `@` and `+` are replaced with `_` to match Bitbucket Server's user slug format
  - Affects `approve_pull_request`, `unapprove_pull_request`, `request_changes`, and `remove_requested_changes` tools
  - Previously, the `+` character would cause 404 errors when approving/requesting changes on PRs

## [1.1.2] - 2025-10-14

### Added
- **CI/CD build status support in `list_pr_commits` tool**:
  - Added `include_build_status` optional parameter to fetch build/CI status for pull request commits
