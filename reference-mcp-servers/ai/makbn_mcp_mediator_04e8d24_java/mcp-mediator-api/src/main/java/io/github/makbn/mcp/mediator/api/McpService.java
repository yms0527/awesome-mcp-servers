/**
 * The {@link McpService} annotation is used to define an MCP (Model Context Protocol) service that provides a set
 * of tools. This annotation maps a service to a unique name, description, and allows the configuration of metadata for
 * the service's operations through associated tools, which are identified by unique names and offer specific
 * functionality.
 * <p>
 * Each service annotated with {@link McpService} can contain multiple tools, each of which is responsible for a
 * specific operation.
 * These tools can modify the system state or interact with external systems as described in the annotations on the
 * methods that implement them.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The tools represented in the service are intended to provide dynamic operations within the system.
 * Each tool is described in detail with input parameters, return types, and their expected behavior.
