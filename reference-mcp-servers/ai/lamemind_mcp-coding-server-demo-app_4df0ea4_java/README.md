# MCP Coding Server Demo with Claude AI

This repository demonstrates the integration of Claude AI into a development workflow using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), showcasing how AI can be effectively utilized in software development processes. The project includes both the MCP integration server and a practical demonstration through a Todo List application.

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project consists of two main components:

1. **MCP Integration Server**
   - A server implementation of the Model Context Protocol
   - Manages context and communication with Claude AI
   - Provides structured prompting and response handling
   - Maintains conversation history and project context

2. **Todo List Application Demo**
   - A practical showcase of AI-assisted development
   - Built with Java EE and Quarkus
   - Demonstrates how Claude AI can assist in real-world application development
