## Development Workflow

### Project Structure
- `src/services/`: Contains all service implementations organized by region (`cn`, `hk`, `sg`, `jp`, `kr`).
- `src/mcp/`: Contains the MCP server definition and tool registration.
- `src/tests/`: Contains unit and integration tests.

### Adding a New Service
1.  Create a new directory in `src/services/<region>/<service-name>`.
2.  Implement the service logic in `service.ts` and types in `types.ts`.
3.  Register the new tool in `src/mcp/server.ts`.
4.  Add unit tests in `src/tests/`.

### Testing
We use Jest for testing. Please ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR.

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test src/tests/unit/my-service.test.ts
```

### Linting
Ensure your code follows the project's coding standards:

```bash
npm run lint
```
