# CeeVee Career Intel — AI Career Intelligence Chat

Start a career intelligence conversation with live web research, knowledge base context, and optional CV-awareness for personalized insights.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Set Up Context (FREE)

**Check for existing CV (optional but recommended):**
1. Call `ceevee_list_versions` to see if the user has uploaded CVs
2. If a CV exists, save the `cv_version_id` of the main version
   - CV context makes responses personalized to the user's seniority, industry, and skills
3. If no CV exists, that's fine — career intel works without one

**Check for existing conversations:**
1. Optionally call `ceevee_list_versions` to check for prior chat history
   - The user may want to continue an existing conversation thread

### Step 2: Start the Conversation (2 credits/message)

If the user provided a topic as `$ARGUMENTS`, use it as the first message. Otherwise, ask what they want to explore.

**Suggested starter topics:**
- "What's the salary range for [role] in [location]?"
- "What skills are most in-demand for [industry] in 2026?"
- "How is AI disrupting [function/industry]?"
- "What career paths lead from [current role] to [target role]?"
- "What should I negotiate for in a [role] offer?"
- "Compare compensation packages: [Company A] vs [Company B]"
- "What certifications matter most for [field]?"
- "How does the job market look for [role] in the next 12 months?"

Call `ceevee_chat` with:
- `message` — The user's question or topic
- `cv_version_id` — If available from Step 1
- `conversation_id` — Omit for first message, include for follow-ups

The response includes:
- **AI analysis** grounded in live web search and knowledge base
- **Sources** — Citations from both KB documents and live search results
- **Conversation ID** — Save this for follow-up messages

### Step 3: Continue the Thread (2 credits/message)

For follow-up questions, always pass the `conversation_id` from Step 2 to maintain conversation context.

The AI retains context from prior messages in the thread, so the user can:
- Drill deeper into a topic ("Tell me more about the AI skills gap")
- Compare alternatives ("How does that compare to cloud architecture roles?")
- Get actionable advice ("What steps should I take in the next 3 months?")
- Request specifics ("What companies in London are hiring for this?")

### Step 4: Alternative Channels

Depending on what the user needs, other tools may be more appropriate:

**For compensation-specific advice:**
- Use `atlas_advisor_chat` (2 credits) for lightweight hiring/compensation questions
- Use `atlas_chat` (3 credits) for workforce intelligence with live tool access to salary benchmarking, supply/demand analysis, and competitor intel

**For CV-specific optimization:**
- Direct to `/ceevee-optimize` for the full positioning pipeline

**For comprehensive research:**
- Direct to `/atlas-report` for a full PDF research report (15 credits)

## Credit Cost

| Action | Cost |
|--------|------|
| Check CV versions | FREE |
| Each chat message | 2 credits |
| Explain a CV edit | 1 credit |

**Typical session:** 3-5 messages = **6-10 credits**

## What Career Intel Covers

The AI combines three intelligence sources for every response:

1. **Knowledge Base** — Curated career intelligence from HBR, McKinsey, BCG, Gartner, and 50+ premium sources, refreshed 3x daily
2. **Live Web Search** — Real-time Tavily search for current salary data, job postings, and market trends
3. **CV Context** (when available) — Personalized to the user's experience level, industry, function, and skill profile

**Best for:**
- Salary and compensation intelligence
- Market trends and industry disruption analysis
- Skill gap identification and upskilling priorities
- Career trajectory planning and pivot analysis
- Negotiation preparation and offer comparison
- Industry-specific hiring trends

**Not for:**
- CV editing (use `/ceevee-optimize`)
- Candidate evaluation (use `/atlas-deep-eval` or `/atlas-shortlist`)
- Full research reports (use `/atlas-report`)

## Tips

- Including a CV makes responses significantly more relevant — the AI calibrates to seniority and industry
- Career intel automatically stores live search findings to the knowledge base, improving future responses
- For salary questions, be specific about role, location, and seniority for the most accurate data
- Conversations are persistent — you can return to a thread later by passing the same `conversation_id`
- Each message costs 2 credits regardless of response length — batch related questions together
