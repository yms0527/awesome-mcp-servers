# Atlas Report — Research Report Generator

Browse 16 report types and generate comprehensive PDF research reports with market data, talent intelligence, and strategic recommendations.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Discover Report Types (FREE)

Call `atlas_list_report_types` to get all 16 available report types.

If the user provided a report type as `$ARGUMENTS`, match it against the available types and skip the browsing step.

Otherwise, present the report types organized by category:

**Recruitment Reports:**
- Talent market landscape
- Salary benchmarking
- Competitor talent analysis
- Sourcing strategy

**Workforce Planning Reports:**
- Skills gap analysis
- Succession planning
- Workforce demographics
- Attrition risk assessment

**Strategic HR Reports:**
- DEI analysis
- Employer branding
- Learning & development
- Organization design
- Employee engagement
- Total rewards benchmarking
- HR technology assessment
- Change management

For each type, show: name, description, credit cost, and required inputs.

Ask the user which report type they want to generate.

### Step 2: Collect Report Inputs

Based on the selected report type, collect the required and optional inputs from the user.

Common inputs across report types include:
- **Industry/sector** — Target industry for the analysis
- **Role/function** — Specific role or job family
- **Location/region** — Geographic scope
- **Company context** — Company name, size, or specific requirements
- **Time horizon** — Analysis period (e.g., 6 months, 1 year, 3 years)

Present the required fields first, then ask about optional fields that would enrich the report.

### Step 3: Confirm and Generate

Before starting generation:
1. Show a summary of the selected report type and all inputs
2. Confirm the credit cost (check the `credits` field from `atlas_list_report_types` — typically 15-40 credits depending on report type)
3. Note that generation takes **2-10 minutes** depending on complexity

Call `atlas_start_report` with:
- `report_type` — The selected report type string
- `inputs` — Object containing all collected inputs

Save the returned `report_id`.

**Important:** `atlas_start_report` returns a `report_id` but does **not** return a `task_id`. Do not attempt to use `careerproof_task_status` for polling — it will not work for reports.

### Step 4: Monitor Progress

Poll `atlas_get_report` with `report_id` every **15-30 seconds** until the `status` field changes to `completed`.

Reports typically take 3-8 minutes to generate. Show progress updates to the user:
- "Researching market data..."
- "Analyzing trends..."
- "Generating report..."

### Step 5: Download Report

Call `atlas_download_report` with `report_id` to get the PDF.

The PDF is returned as base64-encoded content. Present the report summary to the user and confirm the download.

### Step 6: Next Steps

After delivering the report, offer:
- **Generate another report** on a related topic
- **View all reports:** Call `atlas_list_reports` to see previously generated reports
- **Use insights for hiring:** Start a `/atlas-shortlist` workflow informed by the report findings
- **Discuss findings:** Use `atlas_chat` (3 credits/message) for follow-up questions about the data

## Tips

- Call `atlas_list_report_types` first to see exact required inputs for each type — don't guess
- Reports are persisted and can be re-downloaded later via `atlas_download_report`
- Use `atlas_list_reports` to check if a similar report was already generated recently
- For salary-specific questions that don't need a full report, consider `atlas_chat` (3 credits) instead
- Reports use live web research — results reflect current market conditions
- If generation fails, check the error in `atlas_get_report` response and retry with adjusted inputs
