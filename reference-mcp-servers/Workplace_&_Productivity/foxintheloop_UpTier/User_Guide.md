---

## Lists

### Built-in Smart Lists

Six smart lists appear at the top of the sidebar:

| Smart List | What It Shows |
|------------|---------------|
| **My Day** | Tasks due today |
| **Important** | Tasks with priority tier 1 or 2 |
| **Planned** | Tasks with any due date set |
| **Calendar** | Calendar view of all scheduled tasks |
| **Dashboard** | Productivity analytics and stats |
| **Completed** | All completed tasks |

### Regular Lists

Create your own lists to organize tasks by project, area, or however you like.

- Click the **+** button in the sidebar to create a new list
- Each list has a name, color, and icon
- Right-click a list to rename, change color, or delete it
- Drag lists to reorder them in the sidebar
- Deleting a list also deletes all its tasks

### Custom Smart Lists (Filters)

Build custom filtered views using a rule builder:

- Click the filter icon in the sidebar to create a custom smart list
- Combine rules like: due date is this week, priority is tier 1, energy is low, estimated time is under 30 minutes
- All rules are combined with AND logic

## Tasks

### Creating Tasks

Use the **quick-add bar** at the top of any task list. Type a task title and press Enter.

#### Natural Language Input

The quick-add bar understands natural language. You can include dates, times, priorities, tags, and duration all in one line:

| Syntax | Example | Result |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Dates | `tomorrow`, `next friday`, `dec 25` | Sets due date |
| Times | `at 3pm`, `at 14:30`, `at noon` | Sets due time |
| Priority | `!1`, `!2`, `!3`, `!high`, `!low` | Sets priority tier |
| Tags | `#work`, `#shopping`, `#urgent` | Creates/links tags |
| Duration | `30min`, `2h`, `1.5h`, `90m` | Sets estimated time |

**Example:**
```
Review PR for auth module tomorrow at 2pm !1 #code-review 30min
```
This creates a task titled "Review PR for auth module" due tomorrow at 2:00 PM, priority tier 1, tagged "code-review", estimated at 30 minutes.

As you type, parsed tokens appear as colored badges below the input so you can see what's being recognized.

#### Smart List Context

When adding a task from a smart list view, the task inherits context:
- From **My Day**: due date is automatically set to today
- From **Important**: priority is automatically set to tier 1

### Task Properties

Open the detail panel by clicking any task. Available properties:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Title** | Task name |
| **Notes** | Rich text notes for details |
| **Due Date** | When the task is due |
| **Due Time** | Specific time on the due date (for day planner scheduling) |
| **Priority Tier** | Do Now (1), Do Soon (2), or Backlog (3) |
| **Estimated Time** | How long you think it will take (in minutes) |
| **Energy Level** | Low, Medium, or High — how much energy it requires |
| **Recurrence** | Repeat daily, on weekdays, weekly, or monthly |
| **Tags** | Color-coded labels (see Tags section) |
| **Goals** | Link to higher-level goals (see Goals section) |
| **Subtasks** | Checklist items within the task (see Subtasks section) |

### Priority Tiers

Tasks are organized into three priority tiers, shown as collapsible sections in the task list:

| Tier | Label | Meaning |
|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | **Do Now** | Urgent and important — work on immediately |
| 2 | **Do Soon** | Important but not urgent — schedule for soon |
| 3 | **Backlog** | Low priority — do when time permits |

Each tier also has four 1-5 scoring dimensions (effort, impact, urgency, importance) that Claude can set via AI prioritization.

### Drag-and-Drop Reordering

Drag tasks within a list to reorder them. A drag handle appears when you hover over a task.

### Completing and Deleting Tasks

- **Complete**: Click the checkbox next to a task in the list, or select a task and press Space
- **Complete from Detail Panel**: Use the circular checkbox next to the task title in the detail panel
- **Uncomplete**: Click the checkbox again to mark it incomplete
- **Delete**: Select a task and press Delete, or use the delete button in the detail panel
- **Recurring tasks**: Completing a recurring task automatically creates the next instance with the next due date

### Searching Tasks

- Press **Ctrl+F** to focus the search bar in the task list
- Search matches against task titles and notes
- The **Command Palette** (Ctrl+K) also searches tasks across all lists

---

## Subtasks

Subtasks are checklist items within a task, visible in the detail panel.

- **Add**: Type in the input field at the bottom of the subtask list and press Enter
- **Complete**: Click the checkbox next to any subtask
- **Edit**: Click a subtask title to edit it inline
- **Reorder**: Drag subtasks to rearrange them
- **Delete**: Hover over a subtask and click the trash icon

### AI Task Breakdown

Click **"Suggest Task Breakdown"** in the detail panel to get AI-generated subtask suggestions. The system analyzes your task title and notes, matches against common task patterns (meetings, presentations, coding, research, etc.), and suggests relevant subtasks. Click **"Add Subtasks"** to apply them.

---

## Tags

Tags are color-coded labels for categorizing tasks across lists.

- **Create**: Open the tag picker in the task detail panel, or use `#tagname` in the quick-add bar
- **Color**: Each tag has a customizable color — click the color swatch to change it
- **Auto-creation**: Using `#newtagname` in the quick-add bar automatically creates the tag if it doesn't exist
- **Remove**: Click the X on a tag badge in the detail panel to remove it from a task
- **Filter**: Use tags in custom smart list filters to create views like "all #work tasks" or "everything except #personal"

---

## Goals

Goals are higher-level objectives that tasks can be linked to.

### Creating Goals

- Click the **+** button in the Goals section of the sidebar
- Set a name, description, timeframe (daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly), and target date
- Goals support **hierarchy** — nest goals under parent goals (e.g., Yearly > Quarterly > Monthly > Weekly)

### Linking Tasks to Goals

- In the task detail panel, use the goal picker to link a task to one or more goals
- Set an **alignment strength** (1-5) to indicate how directly the task supports the goal
- Claude can also link tasks to goals via the MCP integration

### Progress Tracking

- Click a goal in the sidebar to see its detail panel
- Progress is calculated as: `completed linked tasks / total linked tasks`
- A progress bar and percentage show how close you are to achieving the goal

## Calendar & Scheduling

### Calendar Views

Select **Calendar** from the smart lists in the sidebar. Four view modes are available:

| View | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Day** | Single day with an hourly time grid |
| **Business Week** | Monday through Friday |
| **Full Week** | Sunday through Saturday |
| **Month** | Monthly grid with task indicators |

Click any task on the calendar to open its detail panel. Drag tasks between days to reschedule them.

### Day Planner

The Day view provides a detailed hourly scheduling grid:

- **Time grid**: 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM with hourly rows
- **Task blocks**: Scheduled tasks appear as colored blocks, sized by their estimated duration
- **Unscheduled sidebar**: Tasks due today but without a specific time appear in a sidebar
- **Drag-and-drop**: Drag tasks from the sidebar onto the time grid to schedule them, or drag between time slots to reschedule
- **15-minute snap**: Tasks snap to 15-minute intervals when dragged

### Recurring Tasks

Set a task to repeat on a schedule:

| Frequency | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Daily | Every N days |
| Weekdays | Every weekday (Mon-Fri) |
| Weekly | Every N weeks |
| Monthly | Every N months |

When you complete a recurring task, the next instance is automatically created with the appropriate due date. Set a recurrence end date to stop the cycle.

## Daily Planning

A guided 4-step planning ritual that helps you prepare for your day. Inspired by Sunsama.

### Opening the Planner

- **Auto-launch**: The planning overlay automatically appears on your first app open each day (can be disabled in settings)
- **Sidebar**: Click "Plan My Day"
- **Command Palette**: Ctrl+K, then search for "Plan My Day" or "Plan Another Day..."

### Choosing a Date

A date picker in the planning overlay header lets you plan any date:

- **Quick presets**: Today, Tomorrow, Next Monday
- **Week presets**: "Rest of This Week" (shown Mon-Thu) or "Plan Next Week" — plans Mon through Fri in sequence
- **Calendar**: Pick any future date from a calendar widget

### Week Mode

When you select a week preset, the planner enters week mode:

- A day tab bar appears showing each day (e.g., Mon 17, Tue 18, Wed 19...)
- The 4-step flow runs for each day independently
- Completing one day auto-advances to the next
- Click any tab to jump to a specific day
- Completed days show a checkmark

### The 4 Steps

**Step 1 — Review Previous Day**
See what you completed and what's left over. For incomplete tasks, you can:
- **Reschedule** — Move it to your target date
- **Defer** — Remove the due date for later
- **Drop** — Mark it as complete (abandon it)

The label is dynamic: "Review Yesterday" when planning today, "Review Today" when planning tomorrow, "Review Friday" when planning Monday.

**Step 2 — Build Your List**
A two-column layout shows available tasks on the left and your selected tasks on the right. Click **+** to add tasks to your plan, or **-** to remove them. A capacity meter at the bottom shows how much of your working hours you've filled:
- Green: under 80% — plenty of room
- Amber: 80-100% — getting full
- Red: over 100% — overbooked

**Step 3 — Schedule**
Assign specific times to your planned tasks. Click time slots from 8 AM to 6 PM to schedule each task. A capacity summary shows total planned hours vs available hours.

**Step 4 — Confirm**
Review your plan with summary cards showing task count, estimated hours, and expected finish time. Then:
- **"Start My Day"** — when planning today
- **"Save Plan"** — when planning a future date
- **"Next Day"** — when in week mode with days remaining

### Planning Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Auto-launch | On | Show the planner on first open each day |
| Working hours per day | 8 | Used for capacity calculations |

## Dashboard & Analytics

Select **Dashboard** from the smart lists in the sidebar to view your productivity metrics.

### Today Summary

Four cards at the top show your daily stats:

| Card | What It Shows |
|------|---------------|
| **Completed** | Number of tasks completed today |
| **Completion Rate** | Percentage of today's tasks completed |
| **Focus Time** | Total focus timer minutes logged today |
| **Planned** | Number of tasks due today |

### Weekly Completion Chart

A bar chart showing your daily completion counts for the past 7 days. Today's bar is highlighted.

### Streak Tracking

Your current streak (consecutive days with at least one completed task) and your longest streak are displayed. A flame icon indicates an active streak.

### Focus Goal Progress

A circular progress ring shows how much of your daily focus goal you've completed. Set your daily focus goal in **Settings > Productivity** (default: 120 minutes).

### Priority Distribution

A breakdown of your active tasks by priority tier (Do Now, Do Soon, Backlog) showing the count in each category.

### Streaks & Celebrations

UpTier celebrates your productivity milestones:

---

## AI Features

### Due Date Suggestions

When viewing a task without a due date, UpTier can suggest one based on:
- How long similar tasks in the same list typically take
- The task's priority tier (higher priority = shorter timeframe)
- Avoids suggesting weekends

Click the suggestion to apply it.

### Task Breakdown Suggestions

Click **"Suggest Task Breakdown"** to get AI-generated subtasks. The system recognizes 12 common task types (meetings, presentations, coding features, bug fixes, research, design, testing, etc.) and suggests relevant steps. Click **"Add Subtasks"** to create them all at once.

### At-Risk Deadline Warnings

Tasks that might miss their deadline are flagged with warning indicators:

- **Amber triangle**: Tight buffer — remaining time is less than 2x the estimated duration
- **Red triangle**: Critical — remaining time is less than the estimated duration (can't finish in time)

These indicators appear next to the due date on task items. Hover for a tooltip explaining the risk (e.g., "Only 2h left but task needs ~4h"). The sidebar also shows an amber badge count on My Day and Planned when at-risk tasks exist.

### AI Prioritization (via Claude)

With the Claude MCP integration, you can ask Claude to prioritize your tasks using five strategies:

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Balanced | Weighted combination of effort, impact, urgency, importance |
| Urgent First | Prioritizes by urgency |
| Quick Wins | Low effort + high impact first |
| High Impact | Prioritizes by impact |
| Eisenhower | Classic urgent vs important matrix |

Claude sets priority tiers, scores, and reasoning for each task.

---

## Claude Integration (MCP)

UpTier includes a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that lets Claude Desktop manage your tasks through natural conversation.
