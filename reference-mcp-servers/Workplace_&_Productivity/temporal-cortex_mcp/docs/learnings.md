# Learnings and Key Decisions

Documenting the reasoning behind key decisions made during the development and launch of the Temporal Cortex MCP server.

## Why "cortex-mcp" and Not "calendar-mcp"

The npm package was originally named `@temporal-cortex/calendar-mcp` during development. We renamed to `@temporal-cortex/cortex-mcp` before the first publish for three reasons:

1. **Name collision**: At least 3 other repos use "calendar-mcp" (rauf543/deciduus, etc.). In directory listings where only the unscoped name appears, we'd be indistinguishable.
2. **Binary alignment**: The Rust binary is `cortex-mcp`. Having the npm bin command match means `ps aux | grep cortex-mcp` finds the same process name shown in MCP configs.
3. **Brand recognition**: `cortex-mcp` is distinctive in tool listings while the `@temporal-cortex/` scope communicates it's part of the Temporal Cortex ecosystem.

Precedent: repo names and npm names don't need to match exactly. `nspady/google-calendar-mcp` publishes as `@cocal/google-calendar-mcp` on npm.

## Why This Is a Documentation Repo (Not a Code Repo)

The MCP server source code lives in a private repository. This public repo follows the pattern used by commercial CLI tools (ngrok, tailscale, 1password-cli) that have public GitHub repos for documentation, issues, and community engagement while keeping source private.

Benefits:
- **Directory indexing**: Smithery, Glama, PulseMCP, and mcp.so crawl public GitHub repos. No public repo = invisible.
- **Trust signal**: Developers evaluating whether to grant OAuth calendar access can inspect the tool documentation, architecture, and issue history.
- **Community hub**: Issues filed here are visible to all users, creating a shared knowledge base.
- **SEO**: GitHub repos rank well for "{product} MCP server" searches.

The tradeoff is documentation drift — tool schemas here must stay in sync with the source. We mitigate this by keeping the tool reference tightly coupled to npm package versions.

## Why the `<product>-mcp` Naming Convention

Analysis of 100+ servers on [awesome-mcp-servers](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers) shows that 90%+ use kebab-case with `-mcp` suffix. Including "mcp" in the name is critical for directory crawler discovery — many indexers filter by name pattern.

## Directory Submission Strategy

Different directories have different discovery mechanisms:

| Directory | Discovery Method | What's Needed |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Smithery | `smithery.yaml` in repo root | YAML config file |
| Glama | Auto-indexes GitHub repos with `glama.json` | JSON metadata file |
| Official MCP Registry | `mcp-publisher` CLI + `mcpName` in package.json | `.mcp/server.json` + npm publish |
| PulseMCP | Crawls npm packages with "mcp" keyword | npm keywords + public repo |
| mcp.so | GitHub/npm aggregator | npm package + public repo |
| Cline Marketplace | GitHub Issue on cline/mcp-marketplace | Public repo + 400x400 logo + `llms-install.md` |
| Awesome MCP Servers | PR to punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers | One-line description |

All submissions require the npm package to be published first. Directory crawlers verify that `npx @temporal-cortex/cortex-mcp` actually resolves to a working package.

## The Open-Core Boundary

What's open source (in [temporal-cortex-core](https://github.com/temporal-cortex/core)):
- Truth Engine: RRULE expansion, availability merging, conflict detection
- TOON: Token-Oriented Object Notation encoder/decoder
- Published to crates.io, npm, and PyPI

What's commercial (private):
- Calendar provider integrations (Google, Outlook, CalDAV)
- Two-Phase Commit booking safety layer
- Distributed locking (Redlock)
- OAuth credential management
- Content sanitization firewall
- Usage metering and billing
- The MCP server binary itself

The open-core model works as a funnel: developers discover Truth Engine or TOON, see the MCP server as the productized version, and enterprise users upgrade to the Platform for multi-provider, multi-tenant deployments.

## README Alignment with Master Plan v1.7 (2026-02-21)

- **What changed:** Pricing details removed from public README. "Going to Production?" replaced with "Ready for More?" section featuring three tiers (Managed Cloud Free, Open Scheduling Pro, Enterprise) with no dollar amounts. Free tier updated to v1.7 specs (3 calendars, 50 bookings/mo, 11 tools). Comparison table "Free (Lite)" changed to "Free".
- **Why:** Public repos are not the place for pricing commitments pre-PMF. Anchoring to specific dollar amounts before having paying users creates migration headaches and negotiation anchoring problems. Pricing lives in the master plan and will surface through the product UI when the managed tier ships.
- **Lesson:** Documentation debt compounds. The READMEs drifted through 7 master plan revisions without updates. Establishing a "docs follow strategy" discipline — every master plan version bump should trigger a README review.

## Docker Image for Directory Inspection (2026-02-22)

- **What changed:** Added a `Dockerfile` to the public MCP repo that wraps the published npm package. Also created standard `v*` release tags alongside existing `mcp-v*` tags.
- **Why:** Glama.ai inspects MCP servers by building Docker images and running them. Without a Dockerfile, our server was "not inspectable" — blocking tool discovery, quality scoring, and security scanning. The `mcp-v*` tag prefix wasn't recognized by Glama's release detection (expects standard `v*` format).
- **Lesson:** MCP directory crawlers have different discovery mechanisms. Glama needs a runnable Docker image; the Official MCP Registry needs `.mcp/server.json`; Smithery needs `smithery.yaml`. A docs-only public repo isn't enough for full directory coverage — a thin Docker wrapper bridges the gap without exposing source code. The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build: first stage installs the npm package (requires Node.js + GLIBC 2.39+), second stage copies just the binary into a minimal Debian Trixie slim image (~46 MB).

## Agent Skill: Skill-First Distribution (2026-02-22)

- **What changed:** Created a 4th public repository ([temporal-cortex/skills](https://github.com/temporal-cortex/skills)) containing the Agent Skills. The skills teach AI agents the 7-step scheduling workflow (discover → orient → resolve → query → act) using the MCP server's 18 tools.
- **Why:** The Agent Skills open standard (launched by Anthropic Dec 2025, adopted by 26+ platforms including OpenAI Codex, Google Gemini, GitHub Copilot, Cursor) provides a universal format for procedural knowledge. MCP servers provide tool connectivity; Agent Skills provide the expertise for how to use those tools effectively. Existing calendar skills in the ecosystem are thin wrappers with zero procedural knowledge — Temporal Cortex is the first serious calendar scheduling skill with multi-calendar merging, conflict detection, RRULE expansion, and atomic booking.
- **Key decisions:**
  - Separate repo (not in MCP repo): Different lifecycle (skill content evolves with AI agent patterns, not binary releases), different audience (agents/users vs. developers), simplifies cross-platform distribution (clone and copy the skill folder).
  - Skill name `calendar-scheduling` (generic, descriptive) rather than brand-prefixed: Follows Anthropic's naming convention (1-3 word kebab-case like `pdf`, `doc-coauthoring`), maximizes discoverability, no brand lock-in.
  - Version tracks MCP server (both at 0.3.0): Simpler mental model for users; skill references and tool schemas must match the server version.
  - `.mcp.json` included with local npx default: Agents can install the skill and have the MCP server connection pre-configured for fastest time-to-value.
- **Distribution channels:** SkillsMP (261K+ skills), ClawHub (3.3K+), LobeHub, agentskills.io, GitHub. Same `SKILL.md` format works everywhere.
- **Lesson:** The Agent Skills spec is intentionally minimal — YAML frontmatter + markdown body, progressive disclosure (metadata always loaded → body on trigger → references on demand), 15,000-char system-wide budget. Keep skills lean. The spec's `name` field must exactly match the parent directory name — violating this breaks discovery. ShellCheck in CI catches subtle issues (SC2034 unused variables) that are easy to miss locally.
