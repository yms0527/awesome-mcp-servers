# Code Review Rules

Code review agents must check all items below. These are nitpick-level quality gates — enforce strictly.

## Comments

- No comments that repeat the code. If the code says what it does, a comment saying the same thing is noise.
- Cast justifications must be technically accurate (see Type Safety below).

## Dead Code

Every function, type, and export must have at least one call site at time of writing. No code "for future use" unless explicitly requested.

## Tests

Don't write tests that only verify compile-time guarantees (type assignments, interface conformance). If the compiler checks it, a test adds nothing.

## Type Safety — Cast Review Checklist

For every `as T` cast, verify:
1. Comment explains WHY the cast is necessary
2. Evidence/API docs support the cast being safe
3. A generic type parameter or type guard couldn't eliminate the cast

## TypeScript Type-System Terminology

Branded types (phantom types, opaque types) are compile-time only constructs — erased during transpilation. Common errors to catch:
- "branded at runtime" — oxymoron. At runtime they're plain strings/numbers/etc.
- "branded strings over the same runtime value" — brands don't exist at runtime; say "brands erased at runtime; both are plain strings"
- Cast justifications that imply brands have runtime meaning

Correct pattern: "Brands erased at runtime; both are `string`, so the cast is safe."

## State Space Minimality

For every product type (interface, type alias, Schema struct), verify: can every combination of field values occur in practice? If not, restructure to eliminate impossible states (discriminated union, nested types, `Option` instead of sentinel values). Symptoms:
- `""` / `0` / `null` meaning "not applicable" (sentinel values)
- Boolean alongside fields only meaningful when true/false
- Optional fields that must all be present-or-absent together
- Discriminated union variants carrying fields that only apply to some variants at the product level

## Boundary Typing

All data crossing system boundaries (APIs, etc.) must be strongly typed — both inbound (decoding) and outbound (encoding), with Effect Schema. Flag any `any`, untyped fetch results, or raw JSON access.

## No Bare Primitives for Domain Values

Function signatures and type definitions must never use bare `string`, `number`, or `boolean` where a domain-specific type (union, branded, alias) exists or should exist. This applies to return types, parameters, map key/value types, schema fields, and struct fields.

Examples:
- A function returning `"ChPending" | "ChRunning" | "ChCompleted" | "ChFailed"` must have that union (or a named alias like `DagChildStatus`) as return type, not `string`
- A function producing node IDs must return `DagNodeId`, not `string`
- A timestamp field must use `number` only if no branded type like `Millis` exists; if one does, use it

Symptoms to flag:
- `(s: DomainType): string` — return type loses domain information
- `ReadonlyMap<string, string>` where keys or values have known finite domains
- `Schema.String` in schemas where the field has a known set of valid values (use `Schema.Literals`)
- Bare `number` for quantities that have units or domain meaning (timestamps, indices, counts) when a branded/alias type exists
- Type-narrowing helper that accepts a primitive and returns a type guard — the input might be unavoidable (external data), but document why

## Immutability

No `let` for conditional assignment. Use `const` with:
- Ternary for single-variable branches
- Destructured struct (inline or extracted function) for multi-variable branches
- `yield* Effect.gen(function* () { ... })` when a branch needs effectful computation

Legitimate mutation (accumulators, state flags) must be justified by context — flag if unclear.
