# keepsake-mcp

MCP server for [Keepsake](https://keepsake.place) — the personal CRM that helps you nurture your relationships.

Connect your AI assistant (Claude, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible client) to your Keepsake data: contacts, interactions, tasks, notes, daily journal, companies, and tags.

## Why

Your AI assistant becomes a personal relationship manager. Ask it to:

- "Who did I last talk to at Acme Corp?"
- "Add a note that I ran into Sarah at the conference"
- "What tasks are overdue?"
- "Show me everything related to the #house-project tag"
- "Create a follow-up task for my meeting with John next week"

## Quick start

### 1. Get your API key

Sign up at [keepsake.place](https://keepsake.place), then go to **Account > API Keys** to generate one.

### 2. Configure your MCP client

#### Claude Desktop

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "keepsake": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "keepsake-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "KEEPSAKE_API_KEY": "ksk_YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add keepsake -- npx -y keepsake-mcp
```

Then set `KEEPSAKE_API_KEY` in your environment.

#### Cursor

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "keepsake": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "keepsake-mcp"],
      "env": {

## Tool annotations

All tools include MCP safety annotations:

- **Read-only tools** (`list_*`, `get_*`, `search_*`): marked `readOnlyHint: true`
- **Create tools**: marked `destructiveHint: false`

## Activity tracking

Every write operation (create, update, delete) performed through the API is recorded in an **Activity Feed** visible to the user inside Keepsake. Each action shows the entity type, a content preview, and which API key was used.

This means your user can see everything you do. Be transparent and precise. If you make a mistake, let the user know so they can verify in the activity feed.

Call `get_agent_instructions` at the start of each session for the full best practices guide.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `KEEPSAKE_API_KEY` | Yes | Your API key (starts with `ksk_`) |
| `KEEPSAKE_API_URL` | No | Custom API URL (default: `https://app.keepsake.place/api/v1`) |

## Rate limits

## Privacy

Keepsake MCP server only communicates with the Keepsake API (`app.keepsake.place`). It does not send data to any third-party service. Your data stays between your MCP client and your Keepsake account.

All API calls are authenticated with your personal API key and scoped to your account via Row Level Security. No other user's data is accessible.
