    Calculate the potential profit for a specified trading operation.
    
    This function estimates the result of a trading operation in the current market environment,
    allowing traders to make more informed decisions about position sizing, take-profit levels,
    and overall trade viability before executing a trade.
    
    Args:
        order_type: The type of order (only BUY or SELL supported; can be OrderType enum, string name, or integer code)
        symbol: Financial instrument name (e.g., "EURUSD")
        volume: Trading operation volume in lots
        price_open: Open price at which the position would be entered
        price_close: Close price at which the position would be exited
        
    Returns:
        float: The estimated profit in the account currency if successful
        None: If an error occurred during calculation
        
    Examples:
        >>> calculate_profit(OrderType.BUY, "EURUSD", 0.1, 1.1234, 1.1334)
        10.00
        >>> calculate_profit("SELL", "USDJPY", 0.1, 107.50, 106.50)
        9.30
