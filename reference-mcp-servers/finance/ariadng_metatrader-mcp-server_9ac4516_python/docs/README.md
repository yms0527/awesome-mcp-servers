# MetaTrader MCP Server Documentation 📚

Welcome to the MetaTrader MCP Server documentation! This guide will help you understand how to use our library to connect AI Large Language Models (LLMs) with MetaTrader 5 for automated trading.

## Project Overview 🌟

MetaTrader MCP Server implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI LLMs to interact with and trade using the MetaTrader platform. The project bridges the gap between advanced AI models (like Claude) and the powerful trading capabilities of MetaTrader 5.

## Module Structure 🏗️

The project is organized into two main modules:

### Client Module 🖥️

The client module provides a unified Python interface for MetaTrader 5 automation—connect, trade, analyze, and manage your MT5 terminal with a single, easy-to-use client. Perfect for algo trading, analytics, and robust trading automation! 🚀

**Key Features:**
- Unified `MT5Client` class to manage all MetaTrader 5 operations
- Submodules for account info, market data, trading/order management, historical data, and connection handling
- Simple initialization and configuration
- Designed for both beginners and advanced users

For a detailed guide and usage examples, see the [Client Module Documentation](metatrader_client/README.md).

### Server Module 🌐

The server module implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI assistants like Claude Desktop:

- **MCP Server** - Implements the MCP protocol using the FastMCP SDK
- **MCP Tools** - Provides trading operations as MCP tools
- **Model Integration** - Ready for use with Claude Desktop and other MCP-compatible AI assistants

**Available MCP Tools:**
- `get_balance` - Returns the account balance (currently demo with random values)
- More trading tools coming soon!

## Installation & Usage 💿

```bash
# Install from source
git clone https://github.com/ariadng/metatrader-mcp-server.git
cd metatrader-mcp-server
pip install -e .

# Install MCP CLI tools (if not already installed)
pip install mcp[cli]

# Install the MCP server in Claude Desktop
mcp install src/mcp/main.py
```

## Build 🏗️

To build the package from source:

```bash
pip install build
python -m build
```

## Publish to PyPI 🚀

To publish a new release to PyPI:

```bash
pip install twine
python -m twine upload dist/*
```

## Using with Claude Desktop 🤖

After installing the MCP server in Claude Desktop:

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Start a new conversation
3. Ask Claude to use the MetaTrader tools, e.g. "What's my account balance?"

## Requirements 📋

- Windows 10 or higher
- Python 3.13 or higher
- MetaTrader 5 terminal installed
- Claude Desktop (for AI assistant integration)
