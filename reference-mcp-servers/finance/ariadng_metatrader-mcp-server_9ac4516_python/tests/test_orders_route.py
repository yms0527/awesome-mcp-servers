    # Adjust the patching target to where 'place_market_order' is actually called.
    # This should be the client instance used by your router.
    # Assuming client is accessed as `request.app.state.client` in the route,
    # and `place_market_order` is `request.app.state.client.order.place_market_order`
    # A common way to mock this is to patch the method in the module where it's defined or used.
    # If 'client' in 'metatrader_openapi.routers.orders' is an instance of MT5Client,
    # and 'order' is an attribute holding an Order instance (which has place_market_order),
    # then the target for patching is 'metatrader_openapi.routers.orders.client.order.place_market_order'.
    # This needs to align with how 'client' is instantiated and used in 'orders.py'.

    # Let's assume the client is set up in main.py and passed around, or routers.orders directly imports and uses a client instance.
    # The provided thought process suggests: `monkeypatch.setattr("metatrader_openapi.routers.orders.client.order.place_market_order", mock_place_market_order)`
    # This implies that in 'metatrader_openapi/routers/orders.py', there's an accessible 'client' object.

    # If client is globally available in routers.orders (e.g. from a module-level import or app state)
    # For this example, we'll assume 'client' is an object within 'routers.orders' that has an 'order' attribute.
    # This is a common pattern if 'client' is initialized in 'main.py' and routers access 'app.state.client'.
    # The FastAPI TestClient handles app state correctly, so patching the method on the actual client object
    # used by the app is the most robust approach.
    # However, the prompt specifically suggests monkeypatch.setattr on the module path.

    # The prompt's suggested patch:
    monkeypatch.setattr("metatrader_openapi.routers.orders.client.order.place_market_order", mock_place_market_order)
