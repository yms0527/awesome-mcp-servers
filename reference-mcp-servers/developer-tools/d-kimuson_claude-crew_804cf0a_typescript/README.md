Claude Crew is a tool for creating autonomous coding agents like OpenHands using Claude Desktop and Model Context Protocol (MCP). Unlike coding assistants like Cline that focus on real-time collaboration, Claude Crew aims to create agents that can process tasks autonomously. It excels in delegating low-complexity tasks and enabling non-engineers to implement features using natural language only.

## Concept

Claude Crew focuses on three key elements to maximize Claude Desktop's performance:

- 🎯 Maximizing cost efficiency through efficient context window usage
- 🧪 Prioritizing operation verification through unit testing over browser integration for better token cost performance
- 🔄 Providing project-optimized MCP and context information rather than generic filesystem operations and shell MCP

## Requirements

- Claude Desktop
- OpenAI API key for embedding (optional - but recommended for better context understanding)
- Node.js >= v20

## How it works

Claude Crew provides a configuration CLI and MCP Server.

![](./docs/assets/claude-crew-architecture_en.svg)

The CLI interactively configures project information and provides MCP tools and custom instructions that reflect project information.

Tasks are processed in the following flow:

1. **Task Reception**

   - Receive task requests from users

2. **Project Information Provision**

   - `prepare` tool is automatically invoked to:
     - Update dependencies
     - Update RAG index
     - Pull latest Git changes (if configured)
   - Provide LLM with:
     - Project structure
     - Related source code
     - Related documentation
     - Memory Bank knowledge

3. **Autonomous Task Execution**
   - Linter and unit tests are automatically executed with file operations and provide feedback
   - Implement necessary corrections based on feedback results

Information obtained at each step is optimized for efficient use of the LLM's context window.

## Quick Start

### Project Setup

Move to your project directory and run the setup:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/your-project
$ npx claude-crew@latest setup
```

Configuration files will be generated under `.claude-crew` through an interactive setup process.

> **Note**: Claude Crew can be used with multiple projects simultaneously. Each project generates its own unique configuration, and tool settings are created with project-specific naming to prevent conflicts. For example:

```json
// Project A: /path/to/project-a/.claude-crew/mcp.json
{
  "tools": {
    "project_a_run_test": { ... },
    "project_a_check_types": { ... }
  }
}

// Project B: /path/to/project-b/.claude-crew/mcp.json
{
  "tools": {
    "project_b_run_test": { ... },
    "project_b_check_types": { ... }
  }
}
```

> **Tip**: For easier project management, we recommend cloning projects that use Claude Crew into separate repositories. This allows you to manage the configuration and state of each project independently.

### Claude Desktop Setup

1. Add the MCP settings from `.claude-crew/mcp.json` to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
2. Launch Claude Desktop and create a new Project
3. Add the content of `.claude-crew/instruction.md` to the project's custom instructions

Setup complete! 🎉

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while using Claude Crew, here are some common solutions:

### MCP Server Won't Start

If the MCP server fails to start, it might be due to using an outdated configuration format. Try the following:

1. Check if your `claude_desktop_config.json` matches the format in `.claude-crew/mcp.json`
2. Update the MCP configuration in Claude Desktop with the latest format from `.claude-crew/mcp.json`
3. If the issue persists, refer to the example configuration at `config.example.json` in the project root and adjust your settings accordingly

### Configuration Example

For a complete example of Claude Crew configuration including all available options and integrations setup, refer to `config.example.json` in the project root.

### Database Issues

If you experience database-related problems, you can reset and reinitialize the database:

```bash
# Clean up existing database containers and volumes
$ npx claude-crew clean

# Reinitialize the database
$ npx claude-crew setup-db
```

## Configuration

## Integrations

Claude Crew provides several integrations as extensions. These can be enabled and configured in the `integrations` section of the configuration file.

## Collaboration with Other MCP Tools

While Claude Crew can be used alongside other MCP tools, we recommend following these guidelines:

### Recommended: Disable Similar Tools

We recommend disabling similar tools such as `filesystem` and `claude-code`.

**Reasons:**

- AI agents can proceed with tasks more efficiently when there are fewer choices
- Having duplicate functionality may cause the AI agent to consume extra context in selecting the optimal tool

### Browser Operation Tools

While you can use browser operation tools like `playwright-mcp` to perform browser-based tasks, consider the following:

- Browser-based operation verification tends to consume more context compared to unit testing
- Browser operation tools are not recommended when unit tests can provide sufficient verification
- Consider using browser operation tools when unit testing is challenging (e.g., visual UI verification, complex user interaction testing)

### Adding Custom Instructions

Currently, there is no built-in functionality to automatically integrate custom instructions for other tools.

Alternatives:

- Manually append to the CLI-generated instructions (`.claude-crew/instruction.md`)
- Add instructions for additional tools directly to your project's custom instructions

### Available Integrations

#### TypeScript Integration

An integration that enhances support for TypeScript projects.

```json
{
  "name": "typescript",
  "config": {
    "tsConfigFilePath": "./tsconfig.json"
  }
}
```

| Setting            | Description                               |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `tsConfigFilePath` | Path to the TypeScript configuration file |

**Provided Tools:**

- `{project_name}-search-typescript-declaration` - Search for TypeScript declarations by identifier (function name, class name, interface name, etc.)

#### RAG Integration (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

An extension for searching related documents and information within your project.

  "name": "rag",
  "config": {
    "provider": {
      "type": "openai",
      "apiKey": "your-openai-api-key",
      "model": "text-embedding-ada-002"
    }
  }
}
```

| Setting           | Default Value            | Description                                                       |

| `provider.model`  | "text-embedding-ada-002" | Embedding model to use                                            |

**Provided Tools:**

- `{project_name}-find-relevant-documents` - Find relevant documents based on a query
- `{project_name}-find-relevant-resources` - Find relevant resources based on a query

## Memory Bank

Claude Crew creates a `.claude-crew/memory-bank.md` file to store persistent project knowledge. This file is automatically loaded at the start of each task and contains sections for:

- Project Brief
- Product Context
- System Patterns
- Coding Guidelines

The Memory Bank is designed to be updated throughout project development, serving as a knowledge repository for the AI agent.

## Snippets

Since Claude Desktop does not have an automatic MCP approval feature, we provide a script for automatic approval. This is optional, not mandatory.

The snippet provides the following features:

### Key Features

- **Automatic Tool Approval**: Automatically approves execution of trusted tools (those prefixed with `claude-crew-`)
- **Message Sending Control**: Recommended especially for non-English input. Enables message sending with Ctrl+Enter (optional)

### Usage

1. Generate the snippet:

```bash
# Basic usage
npx claude-crew@latest create-snippet

# Disable Enter key message sending
npx claude-crew@latest create-snippet --disable-send-enter
```

2. Apply in Claude Desktop:
   - Launch Claude Desktop
   - Press `Cmd + Alt + Shift + i` to open Developer Console
   - Paste and execute the generated snippet content in the console

### Options

| Option                 | Default Value | Description                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--disable-send-enter` | `false`       | When `true`, disables message sending on Enter key press |
| `config-path`          | -             | Configuration file path (required)                       |
