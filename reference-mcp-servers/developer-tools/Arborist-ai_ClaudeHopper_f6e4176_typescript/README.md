ClaudeHopper is a specialized Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables Claude and other LLMs to interact directly with construction documents, drawings, and specifications through advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and hybrid search. Ask questions about your construction drawings, locate specific details, and analyze technical specifications with ease.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 Vector-based search for construction document retrieval optimized for CAD drawings, plans, and specs
- 🖼️ Visual search to find similar drawings based on textual descriptions
- 🏢 Specialized metadata extraction for construction industry document formats
- 📊 Efficient token usage through intelligent document chunking and categorization
- 🔒 Security through local document storage and processing
- 📈 Support for various drawing types and construction disciplines (Structural, Civil, Architectural, etc.)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) for local AI models
  - Required models: `nomic-embed-text`, `phi4`, `clip`
- Claude Desktop App
- For image extraction: [Poppler Utils](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/) (`pdfimages` command)

### One-Click Setup

1. Download ClaudeHopper
2. Run the setup script:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/claudehopper
chmod +x run_now_preserve.sh
./run_now_preserve.sh
```

This will:
- Create the necessary directory structure
- Install required AI models
- Process your construction documents
- Configure the Claude Desktop App to use ClaudeHopper

### Adding Documents

Place your construction documents in these folders:

- Drawings: `~/Desktop/PDFdrawings-MCP/InputDocs/Drawings/`
- Specifications: `~/Desktop/PDFdrawings-MCP/InputDocs/TextDocs/`

After adding documents, run:
```bash
./process_pdfdrawings.sh
```

## 🏗️ Using ClaudeHopper with Claude

Try these example questions in the Claude Desktop App:

```
"What architectural drawings do we have for the project?"
"Show me the structural details for the foundation system"
"Find drawings that show a concrete foundation with dimensions"
"Search for lift station layout drawings"
"What are the specifications for interior paint?"
"Find all sections discussing fire protection systems"
```

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

ClaudeHopper uses a multi-stage pipeline for processing construction documents:

1. **Document Analysis**: PDF documents are analyzed for structure and content type
2. **Metadata Extraction**: AI-assisted extraction of project information, drawing types, disciplines
3. **Content Chunking**: Intelligent splitting of documents to maintain context
4. **Image Extraction**: Identification and extraction of drawing images from PDFs
5. **Vector Embedding**: Creation of semantic representations for text and images
6. **Database Storage**: Local LanceDB storage for vector search capabilities

## 👀 Testing the Image Search

To test the image search functionality, you can use the provided test script:

```bash
# Make the test script executable
chmod +x test_image_search.sh

# Run the test script
./test_image_search.sh
```

This will:
- Build the application
- Check for required dependencies (like `pdfimages`)
- Seed the database with images from your drawings directory
- Run a series of test queries against the image search

You can also run individual test commands:

```bash
# Run the test with the default database location
npm run test:image:verbose

# Run the test with a specific database location
node tools/test_image_search.js /path/to/your/database
```

## 📝 Available Search Tools

ClaudeHopper provides several specialized search capabilities:

- `catalog_search`: Find documents by project, discipline, drawing type, etc.
- `chunks_search`: Locate specific content within documents
- `all_chunks_search`: Search across the entire document collection
- `image_search`: Find drawings based on visual similarity to textual descriptions

Examples of using the image search feature can be found in the [image_search_examples.md](examples/image_search_examples.md) file.
