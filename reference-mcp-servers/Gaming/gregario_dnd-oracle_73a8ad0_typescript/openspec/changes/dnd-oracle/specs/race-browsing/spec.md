- **WHEN** the user calls browse_races with no parameters
- **THEN** the tool returns all SRD races (dwarf, elf, halfling, human, dragonborn, gnome, half-elf, half-orc, tiefling) each with a brief trait summary

### Requirement: Race Detail View
The browse_races tool SHALL, when called with a race_name parameter, return the full race details including ability score bonuses, size, speed, languages, racial traits (with full descriptions), and available subraces.

#### Scenario: View race details
- **WHEN** the user calls browse_races with race_name "elf"
- **THEN** the tool returns elf details: +2 Dexterity, Medium size, 30 ft speed, Darkvision, Keen Senses, Fey Ancestry, Trance, and lists subraces (High Elf, Wood Elf, Dark Elf)

#### Scenario: Subrace details
