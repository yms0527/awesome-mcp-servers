    name: "Devastating Wounds",
    description:
      "Critical wounds (unmodified wound roll of 6) inflict mortal wounds equal to the weapon's Damage characteristic instead of normal damage. These mortal wounds bypass the target's armour save entirely.",
    plainEnglish:
      "When you roll a 6 to wound (before any modifiers), the hit skips the enemy's armour save completely and deals mortal wounds equal to the weapon's damage value. This is huge against tough targets with great saves — they just take the damage, no save allowed. The confusing part: it replaces the normal damage for that hit, it doesn't add extra on top.",
    gameModes: ["40k", "combat_patrol"],
    examples: [
      "A weapon with Damage 2 and Devastating Wounds rolls a 6 to wound — the target takes 2 mortal wounds with no save.",

    name: "Lethal Hits",
    description:
      "Critical hits (unmodified hit roll of 6) automatically wound the target — no wound roll required.",
    plainEnglish:
      "When you roll a natural 6 to hit, you skip the wound roll entirely — it just wounds automatically. This is great against really tough targets where you'd normally need a 5+ or 6 to wound, because you bypass that bad wound roll completely.",
    gameModes: ["40k", "combat_patrol"],
    examples: [
      "Shooting Strength 4 weapons into Toughness 10? Normally you need 6s to wound. With Lethal Hits, every 6 to hit just wounds automatically.",

  {
    name: "Sustained Hits",
    description:
      "Critical hits (unmodified hit roll of 6) generate extra hits. Sustained Hits X generates X additional hits; Sustained Hits without a number generates 1 extra hit.",
    plainEnglish:
      "Every time you roll a natural 6 to hit, you score bonus hits on top of the one you already landed. 'Sustained Hits 1' means one extra hit per 6. 'Sustained Hits 2' means two extra. These bonus hits still need to roll to wound as normal — they're not auto-wounds.",
    gameModes: ["40k", "combat_patrol"],
    examples: [
      "A unit with Sustained Hits 1 rolls three 6s out of ten shots — that's 13 hits total (10 original + 3 bonus).",

  {
    name: "Anti-X",
    description:
      "Improves the critical wound threshold against targets with a specific keyword. Anti-Infantry 4+ means unmodified wound rolls of 4+ are critical wounds against Infantry.",
    plainEnglish:
      "This weapon is specialised against a particular type of target. 'Anti-Infantry 4+' means when shooting at Infantry, your wound rolls of 4+ count as critical wounds (6s). Why does that matter? Because critical wounds trigger things like Devastating Wounds and Sustained Hits. On its own, Anti-X doesn't change your wound roll — but paired with Dev Wounds, it's devastating.",

    description:
      "When targeting a unit with 6+ models, add 1 to the Attacks characteristic for each 5 models in the target unit (minimum +1). Cannot be used for Overwatch.",
    plainEnglish:
      "Blast weapons get bonus shots when shooting at big groups — the bigger the mob, the more shots you get. For every 5 models in the target unit, add 1 attack. A unit of 10 models gives you +2 attacks. The catch: you can never use Blast weapons during Overwatch (the reactive shooting when someone charges you).",

    description:
      "If the bearer's unit Remained Stationary this phase, add 1 to hit rolls made with this weapon.",
    plainEnglish:
      "Stand still and you shoot better — you get +1 to your hit rolls. If you moved at all this turn, you shoot at normal accuracy. This rewards a 'hold your ground and shoot' playstyle. The +1 can make a big difference: a 4+ to hit becomes a 3+.",

      "When targeting a unit within half the weapon's range, increase the Attacks characteristic by the Rapid Fire value.",
    plainEnglish:
      "Get close and you fire more shots. 'Rapid Fire 1' on a 24\" weapon means at 12\" or closer, you get +1 attack per model. 'Rapid Fire 2' means +2 attacks up close. The classic bolter is Rapid Fire 1 — at long range you fire one shot, up close you fire two.",
    gameModes: ["40k", "combat_patrol"],

      "This weapon can be fired even if the bearer's unit Advanced this turn, but hit rolls suffer a -1 penalty if the unit Advanced.",
    plainEnglish:
      "You can shoot this weapon even after Advancing (the extra-fast move). Normally, if you Advance you can't shoot at all. Assault weapons let you — but you take a -1 to hit as a trade-off. Great for aggressive play where you want to close distance fast while still shooting.",

    description:
      "This weapon can be fired even if the bearer's unit is within Engagement Range of enemy models, but it must target one of those enemy units and can only be fired if the unit is not eligible to shoot other weapons.",
    plainEnglish:
      "Pistols are the only ranged weapons you can fire while locked in melee combat. If your unit is in close combat (within Engagement Range), you can still shoot your pistol at whoever you're fighting. You can't shoot any other guns though — it's pistols or nothing when you're in melee.",

    description:
      "This weapon automatically hits the target — no hit roll required.",
    plainEnglish:
      "Flamers and similar weapons — you don't roll to hit at all, every attack automatically hits. This makes Torrent weapons extremely reliable. A Torrent weapon with D6 attacks will always land D6 hits. Ballistic Skill doesn't matter; modifiers to hit don't matter. Just point and burn.",

      "This weapon can re-roll its wound rolls.",
    plainEnglish:
      "You can re-roll any failed wound rolls with this weapon. Not hit rolls — wound rolls. This makes the weapon much more consistent at actually dealing damage. If you roll badly on your wound step, just pick up those dice and roll them again.",

    plainEnglish:
      "Get close and the weapon hits way harder. 'Melta 2' on a 12\" weapon means at 6\" or less, add 2 to the damage of each hit. Melta weapons are the classic tank-busters — already strong at range, absolutely devastating up close. The risk-reward is real: you have to get dangerously close.",

    plainEnglish:
      "Powerful but risky — after shooting, you roll a die for each Hazardous weapon you fired. On a 1, your own unit takes 3 mortal wounds (or the model just dies if it's a Character/Monster/Vehicle). Think of plasma guns overheating. Usually worth the risk, but sometimes your own guy explodes.",

    plainEnglish:
      "Normally, you can't snipe Characters who are leading a unit — your hits get allocated to the bodyguard models first. Precision weapons can bypass this on a natural 6 to hit: those critical hits can be allocated directly to the Character. This is how you pick off enemy leaders hiding behind their squads.",

    plainEnglish:
      "You can shoot at enemies you can't see — hidden behind walls, in buildings, whatever. But it's less accurate (-1 to hit) and the target gets cover (usually +1 to their save). Still very useful because some units hide all game; this forces them to move or take damage. Your opponent might not realise you can hit their hidden units.",

    plainEnglish:
      "An extra saving throw after all your other saves have failed. Your model is about to lose a wound? Roll a die — on the FNP value or higher, you shrug it off. 'Feel No Pain 5+' means you ignore each wound on a 5 or 6 (a 1-in-3 chance). This even works against mortal wounds, which is rare and very powerful. It stacks on top of your armour save — it's a completely separate roll.",

    plainEnglish:
      "This model is hard to shoot at range — enemies can only target it with ranged weapons if they're within 12\". Beyond that, it's basically invisible to enemy guns. Great for sneaky characters moving up the board. But once an enemy gets within 12\", the protection vanishes completely.",

    plainEnglish:
      "Enemies shooting at this unit take a -1 penalty to their hit rolls. Simple but effective — it turns a 3+ to hit into a 4+ to hit, which means roughly 17% fewer hits. Stacks with other to-hit penalties like cover, making the unit surprisingly hard to pin down at range.",

    plainEnglish:
      "Instead of deploying on the table at the start, this unit waits off-board and drops in later — anywhere you want, as long as it's more than 9\" from enemies. This is incredibly flexible for getting behind enemy lines or grabbing undefended objectives. The downside: 9\" is far for a charge (you need a 9 on 2D6), so shooting units benefit more than melee units unless you have charge bonuses.",
