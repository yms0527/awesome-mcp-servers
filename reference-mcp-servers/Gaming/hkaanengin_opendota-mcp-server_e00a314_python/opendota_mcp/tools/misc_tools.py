        Get statistical benchmarks for a hero (average performance metrics across all skill levels).
        
        Use this when users ask:
        - "What are the average stats for [hero]?"
        - "What's a good GPM/XPM for [hero]?"
        - "Show me benchmark stats for [hero]"
        - "What's the typical performance for [hero]?"
        - "How do I compare to other [hero] players?"
        
        Returns percentile-based benchmarks showing what constitutes below-average, average,
        good, and exceptional performance for various metrics on this hero. Useful for
        comparing a player's performance to the general population.
        
        Supports both hero IDs and natural language hero names.
        
        Args:
            hero_id: Hero to get benchmarks for. Accepts:
                - Integer: Hero ID (e.g., 86 for Rubick)

        Returns:
            Dictionary containing benchmark statistics organized by metric.
            Each metric shows percentile breakdowns (e.g., 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9)
            representing the 10th, 25th, 50th (median), 75th, and 90th percentiles.
            
            Common metrics included:
            - gold_per_min: GPM benchmarks by percentile
            - xp_per_min: XPM benchmarks by percentile
            - kills_per_min, deaths_per_min, assists_per_min: KDA-related benchmarks
            - last_hits_per_min: Farming efficiency benchmarks
            - hero_damage_per_min: Combat effectiveness benchmarks
            - hero_healing_per_min: Support/healing benchmarks
            - tower_damage: Objective damage benchmarks
            - stuns_per_min: Crowd control benchmarks
            - And many more...
            
        Common queries:
            - General benchmarks: get_benchmarks("Rubick")
            - Compare player stats: First get player stats with get_player_totals(),
            then compare to benchmarks from this function

                "gold_per_min": {
                    "0.1": 250.5,   # 10th percentile - below average
                    "0.25": 310.2,  # 25th percentile - low average
                    "0.5": 380.7,   # 50th percentile (median) - average
                    "0.75": 450.3,  # 75th percentile - above average
                    "0.9": 520.8    # 90th percentile - excellent
                },

                ...
            }
            
        Interpretation: If a player has 460 GPM on Rubick, they're performing around
        the 75th percentile (better than 75% of Rubick players).

        win rates. Generally, earlier timings have higher win rates for core items,
        helping identify optimal farming targets and build orders.
        
        Supports natural language item and hero names.
        
        Args:
            item_name: Item to analyze. Accepts item names like:
                - Core items: "bfury" (Battle Fury), "radiance", "midas" (Hand of Midas)
                - Mobility: "blink" (Blink Dagger), "force" (Force Staff)
                - Defense: "bkb" (Black King Bar), "linkens" (Linken's Sphere)
                - Boots: "travels" (Boots of Travel), "phase" (Phase Boots)
                - Support: "wards", "mek" (Mekansm)
                - And many more item names/abbreviations
            hero_name: Hero to analyze. Accepts:
                - Integer: Hero ID (e.g., 86 for Rubick)
                - String: Hero name (e.g., "Rubick", "Anti-Mage")
            
            Note: At least one parameter must be provided. You can provide:
            - Only item_name: See which heroes buy this item and when
            - Only hero_name: See all item timings for this hero
            - Both: See specific item timing for specific hero
        
        Returns:
            Dictionary organized by timing brackets (formatted as "MM:SS").
            Structure depends on parameters provided:
            
            If only item_name provided:
            - item_name (str): The item being analyzed
            - [time brackets]: Keys like "12:30", "15:00", etc., each containing list of:
                - hero_name (str): Hero name
                - games (int): Games with this timing
                - wins (int): Wins with this timing
                - win_rate (str): Win rate percentage (e.g., "65.3")
                
            If only hero_name provided:
            - hero_name (str): The hero being analyzed
            - [time brackets]: Keys like "12:30", "15:00", etc., each containing list of:
                - item_name (str): Item name
                - games (int): Games with this timing
                - wins (int): Wins with this timing
                - win_rate (str): Win rate percentage
                
            If both provided:
            - hero_name (str): The hero
            - item_name (str): The item
            - [time brackets]: Keys like "12:30", "15:00", etc., each containing list of:
                - games (int): Games with this timing
                - wins (int): Wins with this timing
                - win_rate (str): Win rate percentage
        
        Common queries:
            - Optimal item timing: get_scenarios_item_timings(item_name="bfury", hero_name="Anti-Mage")
            - Best heroes for item: get_scenarios_item_timings(item_name="blink")
            - Hero's item timings: get_scenarios_item_timings(hero_name="Anti-Mage")
        
        Example:
            get_scenarios_item_timings(item_name="bfury", hero_name="Anti-Mage")
            -> {
                "hero_name": "Anti-Mage",
                "item_name": "bfury",
                "10:00": [{"games": 12, "wins": 10, "win_rate": "83.3"}],
                "12:00": [{"games": 45, "wins": 32, "win_rate": "71.1"}],
                "15:00": [{"games": 234, "wins": 145, "win_rate": "62.0"}],
                "18:00": [{"games": 189, "wins": 98, "win_rate": "51.9"}],
                "21:00": [{"games": 87, "wins": 38, "win_rate": "43.7"}],
                ...
            }
            
        This clearly shows that Anti-Mage's win rate with Battle Fury decreases
        significantly as the timing gets later. A 12-minute Battle Fury has 71% win rate,
        while an 18-minute Battle Fury only has 52% win rate, suggesting you should
        aim for Battle Fury before 15 minutes for optimal results.
