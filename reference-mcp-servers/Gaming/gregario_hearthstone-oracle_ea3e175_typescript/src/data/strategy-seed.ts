    category: 'fundamental',
    description: 'Having more cards (or more useful cards) in hand than your opponent. The player with more options has more flexibility to answer threats and deploy their own.',
    hearthstone_application: 'Warlock\'s Life Tap hero power is the ultimate card advantage tool. Board clears that destroy multiple minions with one card generate card advantage. 2-for-1 trades (one card killing two) build advantage over time.',
  },
  {
    name: 'tempo',
    category: 'fundamental',
    description: 'The pace of play and who holds the initiative on board. A tempo advantage means your board is more developed relative to mana spent.',
    hearthstone_application: 'Spending mana efficiently each turn (coining out a 2-drop on turn 1, playing on curve). Cards like Backstab (0 mana removal) are pure tempo. Going first gives a tempo advantage. Tempo is often traded for value and vice versa.',
  },
  {
    name: 'value',
    category: 'fundamental',
    description: 'Getting more impact per card played. A high-value card does more than one card\'s worth of work — either through card generation, multiple effects, or 2-for-1 trades.',
    hearthstone_application: 'Discover effects generate extra cards from one card played. Siphon Soul (destroy + heal) provides two effects. Trading a single minion into two enemy minions is a value trade. Value and tempo are often in tension — high-value plays are often slow.',
  },
  {
    name: 'board control',
    category: 'fundamental',
    description: 'Dominating the minion battlefield. The player who controls the board dictates trades, pressures the opponent, and forces reactive plays.',
    hearthstone_application: 'Trading efficiently with minions (using a 3/2 to kill their 2/3 after pinging with hero power). Taunts protect your board. Going first helps establish board control. Losing board control against aggro is often game-losing.',
  },
  {
    name: 'mana curve',
    category: 'fundamental',
    description: 'The distribution of card costs in your deck. A smooth curve means having playable cards at every mana point, ensuring you spend your mana efficiently each turn.',
    hearthstone_application: 'Aggro decks need low curves (mostly 1-3 cost) to apply early pressure. Control decks can afford gaps in their curve because they hero power on empty turns. Having a "1-2-3" opening (playing on curve for turns 1, 2, 3) is critical for tempo and aggro decks.',
  },
  {
    name: 'fatigue',
    category: 'hearthstone-specific',
    description: 'When your deck is empty, each draw attempt deals increasing damage (1, then 2, then 3, etc.). A unique Hearthstone mechanic that creates a natural game timer.',
    hearthstone_application: 'Relevant in control mirrors where both players exhaust their decks. Warlock\'s Life Tap accelerates fatigue. Cards that shuffle into your deck delay fatigue. Mill strategies (forcing opponent to draw) weaponise fatigue damage. Dead Man\'s Hand Warrior was the ultimate fatigue deck.',
  },
  {
    name: 'resource management',
    category: 'fundamental',
    description: 'Balancing the four resources — health, cards in hand, mana, and board presence. Spending one resource to gain another is the core decision of every turn.',
    hearthstone_application: 'Health IS a resource — Warlock pays health for cards (Life Tap), and this is often correct. Knowing when to take face damage to develop board. Using mana efficiently means not floating mana. Overcommitting to board (spending all cards) leaves you vulnerable to clears.',
  },
  {
    name: 'win condition',
    category: 'fundamental',
    description: 'The specific way your deck plans to win the game. Every deck needs a clear path to victory, and all other cards should support that path.',
    hearthstone_application: 'Aggro\'s win condition is face damage before opponent stabilises. Control wins through attrition and late-game threats. Combo wins through specific card combinations (e.g., Leeroy + Shadowstep). Identifying your win condition each game informs every decision — trade or go face, draw or develop, play for tempo or value.',
