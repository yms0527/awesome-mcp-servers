## Example Use Cases

The goal is for you to have an easy way to fetch more accurate data right from the source while scaping.

"What is the id of an abbyssal whip?"
```

## Getting Started

[Introduction to MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)

You can use the MCP server in many clients, for example:

- Claude desktop
- Cursor

### 1. Add the MCP server in your config (NPM Package)

Paste this snippet in your mcp config that your client is using

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server-runescape": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-server-runescape"]
    }
  }
}
```

You can find the config file in (mac):

- Claude desktop:

`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

- Cursor:

`/Users/name/.cursor/mcp.json`

### 2. From Source

**Required** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed on your system

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash   
   yarn
   ```
   or
   ```bash   
   npm install
   ```
3. Then update your Claude desktop or Cursor with:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "mcp-server-runescape": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/Users/path/to/mcp-server-runescape/src/server.js"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
4. **Optional**: Run the debugger/inspector
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
   or
   ```bash   
   npm run build
   ```

Make sure to:

- Replace `/path/to/mcp-server-runescape` with the actual path to your installation.

After updating the configuration, restart Claude desktop or Cursor for the changes to take effect.

#### Personal preference

You can use any client you want, my personal preference goes to Cursor at the moment in combination with deepseek-v3.1 which is performing really well.

## Thank you

I built this over the weekend, to learn a bit more about MCP servers. Runescape was the perfect subject to try it out on.

- Shout out to the rs/wiki team for the docs and API.

If this helps you out in anyway when scaping and you would like to support me, feel free to
