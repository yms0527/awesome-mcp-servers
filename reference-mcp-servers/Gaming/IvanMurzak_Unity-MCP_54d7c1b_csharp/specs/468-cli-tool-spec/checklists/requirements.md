# Specification Quality Checklist: Unity-MCP CLI Tool

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. The spec references specific file paths (`manifest.json`, `ProjectVersion.txt`) and environment variable prefixes (`UNITY_MCP_*`) as domain concepts rather than implementation details — these are part of the Unity ecosystem and the product's interface contract.
- The spec was informed by the existing CLI codebase which already implements all 7 commands described. This spec documents the intended behavior comprehensively.
- **Clarification session 2026-03-14**: 4 questions asked and resolved — TTY auto-detection, network failure strategy, open/connect command merge, verbose flag. All integrated into spec sections.
