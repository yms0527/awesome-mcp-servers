## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started): Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.
- **Gemini API Key:** Required for core AI functionality. Obtain a free API key from [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/).
- **Brave API Key (Optional):** Enhances search capabilities. Obtain a free API key from [Brave Search API](https://brave.com/search/api/).
- **Together API key (Optional, required for Reasoner Pro):** Enhances the answer way more, but way slower, useful for advance coding questions. Obtain a free API key from [Together API](https://api.together.ai/)

### Available Tools

- **WEB** – Allows access to the internet. Prompt your queries with natural instructions like:  
  *“Search online how to create an MCP server.”*

- **STACK** – Searches Stack Overflow for developer-relevant answers and code examples.  
  Great for resolving language-specific or library-related issues.

- **INTERNAL** – Searches internal documentation or knowledge bases, such as team wikis or private datasets.  
  Use when your answer likely exists within internal sources.

- **PYTHON** – Executes Python code in an isolated environment.  
  Useful for testing logic, calculations, or snippets.

- **COMPUTE** – Handles complex mathematical computations or factorial operations.  
  Example: *“What is 756!?”*

- **VISUALIZE** – Transforms raw log data into charts or graphs.  
  Example: *“Provide logs and give me a visualization of CPU usage over time.”*

- **SAST** – Performs static application security testing (SAST) on Python code.  
  Detects vulnerabilities, bad patterns, and unsafe practices.

- **LIGHTNING** – Delivers very fast answers to lightweight or fact-based questions.  
  Optimized for speed over deep reasoning.
  
- **DEEP ANALYSIS** - Analyses the large codes in detail, mostly 50000+ character codes
  Can you give me a deep anaysis of the code

- **GITHUB** - Uses GitHub API to fetch examples and learn from them more effectively

- **CONTEXT** - Allows you to upload your codebase and provide context to your queries
  

## Main Chain of Thought

### ✅ Overview

The workflow follows a structured decision-making and response generation pipeline, enhanced by reinforcement learning and multi-model reasoning.

---

### ⚙️ 1. Tool Selection & Execution

* Checks for an appropriate tool.
* Executes it immediately if available for a fast, actionable response.

---

### 🧠 2. Sentiment & Behavior Analysis

* Evaluates user sentiment and past interactions.
* Skipped if no behavioral history exists.

---

### 🌐 3. Resource Retrieval

* Fetches additional resources (e.g., web data, Stack Overflow, internal KBs) when needed.

---

### 🧬 4. Reinforcement Learning Feedback

* Uses sentiment data to reward or penalize the RL agent.
* Influences future decisions and model behaviors.

---

### 🧾 5. Response Generation

* Combines sentiment, context, and history to produce an initial response.

---

### 🪞 6. Response Refinement

* Enhances clarity, quality, and coherence of the response.

---

### 🧠 7. Multi-Model Reasoning

* Invokes models like Gemini and others for deeper, more diverse insights based on reasoning level.

---

### ⚡ 8. Fast Path Return

* Skips validation when speed is critical and returns the response immediately.

---

### 🔁 9. Quick Reasoning Path

* Uses a lightweight reasoner.
* Validates up to 3 times using the best prior answer.
* Iterates without external model input.

---

### 🧩 10. Pro-Level Reasoning

* Engages advanced models and third-party outputs.
* Ensures broader context and selects the best response.

---

### 🧠 11. RL Agent Optimization

* Continuously tunes the RL agent via rewards/penalties.
* Chooses the optimal result after multiple iterations.

---

### 🎯 12. Greedy Optimization Strategy

* Prioritizes the best possible outcome.
* May settle early if minimum quality is met.


## Code Analyst Chain 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46dbc438-cb0f-4deb-9412-344c3cf74f08)

Designed for deep analysis of large codebases, **CodeAnalystPro** excels at code explanation and modification. Below is the step-by-step workflow:

### 1. **Code Chunking**

* Splits the source code into manageable segments of **2,000–5,000 characters**.

### 2. **Chunk Analysis with Retry Logic**

* Each chunk is analyzed.
* Up to **5 retry attempts** are allowed to improve accuracy.

### 3. **Context-Aware Modification**

* Modifications are made with awareness of:

  * The **current chunk**.
  * **Previously generated outputs**.
* Ensures output consistency across chunks.

### 4. **Fallback Mechanism**

* If a chunk **fails validation**:

  * The **best previous version** is reused.
  * The **context window is reduced** to limit hallucinations.

### 5. **Validation Threshold**

* Chunks must meet a **90% validation score** to proceed.
* If validation passes, the system advances to the next chunk.

### 6. **Iterative Refinement**

* Each chunk is either **corrected or explained** before moving on.

### 7. **Final Output Reconstruction**

* All chunks are reassembled into a final version.
* A **lightweight Gemini model** performs final polishing and cleanup.

### Installation

1. **Pull the Docker image:**

```shell
docker pull stefankumarasinghe/codemasterpro
```
Please use the relevant tags, for best performance, there is amd64, arm64 and latest which is compatible for both (but heavy)

2. **Run the Docker container:**

```shell
docker run -e GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY -p 8000:8000 stefankumarasinghe/codemasterpro
```
While you can also have the BRAVE_API_KEY and TOGETHER_AI_API_KEY using -e and other Integrations, CodeMasterPro allows you to set via the UI

- Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your actual Gemini API key.
- Replace `YOUR_BRAVE_API_KEY` with your Brave API key (if you have one).
- Replace `TOGETHER_AI_API_KEY` with your Together key

- Make sure to create an .env, if you are doing it via the terminal (root-level)
- Make sure to have the port 8000 ready as well
- New update no longer requires you to put these variables as it can be set via the UI
