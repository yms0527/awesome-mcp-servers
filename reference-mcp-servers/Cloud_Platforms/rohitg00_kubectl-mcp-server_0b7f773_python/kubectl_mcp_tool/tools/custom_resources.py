"""Dynamic CRD discovery and custom resource management tools.

Solves a critical gap: LLMs don't know what CRDs are installed in a cluster
or what they represent. When a user asks "show me databases in my cluster",
these tools let the LLM discover that CNPG, Percona, RDS operator CRDs exist,
understand they are database operators, and list their actual instances.

Tools:
    discover_crds       - Scan cluster CRDs with semantic categorization
    search_crds         - Natural language CRD search ("databases", "monitoring")
    list_custom_resources - List instances of any custom resource type
    get_custom_resource  - Get full details of a specific CR instance
    describe_crd        - Show CRD schema and field documentation
