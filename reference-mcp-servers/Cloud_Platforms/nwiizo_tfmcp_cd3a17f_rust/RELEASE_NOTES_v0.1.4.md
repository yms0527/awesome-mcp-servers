# Release Notes - tfmcp v0.1.4

**Release Date:** December 8, 2024

## 🔧 Critical Bug Fixes

This release addresses several critical functionality issues identified during comprehensive testing and verification. All fixes improve the stability and reliability of the MCP server operations.

### Fixed Issues

1. **🚨 Fixed `analyze_terraform` returning null analysis**
   - **Issue:** The `analyze_terraform` tool was returning `{"analysis": null}` instead of proper analysis data
   - **Fix:** Modified `TfMcp::analyze_terraform()` to return `TerraformAnalysis` data structure instead of `()`
   - **Impact:** MCP tool now correctly returns Terraform configuration analysis with resource information

2. **🚨 Fixed `set_terraform_directory` response format error**
   - **Issue:** MCP handler was returning "Field required" error for proper MCP response format
   - **Fix:** Converted response to proper MCP text response format with structured message
   - **Impact:** Directory changes now work correctly through Claude Desktop integration

3. **🔧 Enhanced `get_chunked_response` error handling**
   - **Issue:** Large responses were causing errors during chunking process
   - **Fix:** Improved parameter validation and error messages for chunked responses
   - **Impact:** Better handling of large Terraform outputs and provider documentation

4. **💡 Improved `list_terraform_resources` error messages**
   - **Issue:** Unhelpful error messages when no Terraform state file exists
   - **Fix:** Added comprehensive guidance for common scenarios:
     - No resources created yet (suggest `terraform apply`)
     - Project not initialized (suggest `terraform init`)
     - State file deleted or moved
   - **Impact:** Users get clear actionable guidance when encountering state issues

5. **📚 Fixed `get_provider_docs` empty array returns**
   - **Issue:** Provider documentation requests were returning empty arrays
   - **Fix:** Enhanced error handling and added helpful messages when documentation is not found
   - **Impact:** Better user experience when searching for provider documentation

## 🛠️ Technical Improvements

- **Code Quality:** Fixed all compilation warnings and clippy issues
- **Testing:** All 106 tests pass successfully across all modules
- **CI/CD:** Updated GitHub Actions workflow to handle dead code warnings appropriately
- **Documentation:** Enhanced error messages with actionable guidance

## 🧪 Testing & Verification

- ✅ **106 tests passing** across unit tests, integration tests, and compilation tests
- ✅ **Zero clippy warnings** (with appropriate dead code allowances for future modules)
- ✅ **All critical functionality verified** through comprehensive manual testing
- ✅ **CI/CD pipeline updated** and working correctly
