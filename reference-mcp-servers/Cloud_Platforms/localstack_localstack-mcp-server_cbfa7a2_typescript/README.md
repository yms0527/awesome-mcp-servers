# LocalStack MCP Server

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The LocalStack MCP server is currently available as an experimental public preview. For questions, issues or feedback, please utilize the [LocalStack Community slack](https://slack.localstack.cloud) or submit a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-mcp-server/issues)

A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) (MCP) server that provides tools to manage and interact with your [LocalStack for AWS](https://www.localstack.cloud/localstack-for-aws) container for simplified local cloud development and testing. The LocalStack MCP Server provides simplified integration between MCP-compatible apps and your local LocalStack for AWS development environment, enabling secure and direct communication with LocalStack's emulated services and additional developer experience features.

This server eliminates custom scripts and manual LocalStack management with direct access to:

- Start, stop, restart, and monitor LocalStack for AWS container status with built-in auth.
- Deploy CDK, Terraform, and SAM projects with automatic configuration detection.
- Search LocalStack documentation for guides, API references, and configuration details.
- Parse logs, catch errors, and auto-generate IAM policies from violations. (requires active license)
- Inject chaos faults and network effects into LocalStack to test system resilience. (requires active license)
- Manage LocalStack state snapshots via [Cloud Pods](https://docs.localstack.cloud/aws/capabilities/state-management/cloud-pods/) for development workflows. (requires active license)
- Install, remove, list, and discover [LocalStack Extensions](https://docs.localstack.cloud/aws/capabilities/extensions/) from the marketplace. (requires active license)
- Launch and manage [Ephemeral Instances](https://docs.localstack.cloud/aws/capabilities/cloud-sandbox/ephemeral-instances/) for remote LocalStack testing workflows.
- Connect AI assistants and dev tools for automated cloud testing workflows.

## Tools Reference

This server provides your AI with dedicated tools for managing your LocalStack environment:

For other MCP Clients, refer to the [configuration guide](#configuration).

### Prerequisites

- [LocalStack CLI](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/installation/#localstack-cli) and Docker installed in your system path
- [`cdklocal`](https://github.com/localstack/aws-cdk-local), [`tflocal`](https://github.com/localstack/terraform-local), or [`samlocal`](https://github.com/localstack/aws-sam-cli-local) installed in your system path for running infrastructure deployment tooling
- A [valid LocalStack Auth Token](https://docs.localstack.cloud/aws/getting-started/auth-token/) configured as `LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN` (**required for all MCP tools**)
- [Node.js v22.x](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or higher installed in your system path

### Configuration

Add the following to your MCP client's configuration file (e.g., `~/.cursor/mcp.json`). This configuration uses `npx` to run the server, which will automatically download & install the package if not already present:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "localstack-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@localstack/localstack-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

All LocalStack MCP tools require `LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN` to be set. You can get your LocalStack Auth Token by following the official [documentation](https://docs.localstack.cloud/aws/getting-started/auth-token/).

If you installed from source, change `command` and `args` to point to your local build:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "localstack-mcp-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/your/localstack-mcp-server/dist/stdio.js"],
      "env": {
        "LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
      } 
    }
  }
}
```

## LocalStack Configuration

| Variable Name | Description | Default Value |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| `LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN` (**required**) | The LocalStack Auth Token to use for the MCP server | None |
| `MAIN_CONTAINER_NAME` | The name of the LocalStack container to use for the MCP server | `localstack-main` |
| `MCP_ANALYTICS_DISABLED` | Disable MCP analytics when set to `1` | `0` |

## Contributing

Built on the [XMCP](https://github.com/basementstudio/xmcp) framework, you can add new tools by adding a new file to the `src/tools` directory and documenting it in the `manifest.json` file.

Pull requests are welcomed on GitHub! To get started:

- Install Git and Node.js
- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies with `yarn`
- Build with `yarn build`

### MCP Server Tester

This repository includes [MCP Server Tester](https://github.com/gleanwork/mcp-server-tester) for tool validation in direct mode and LLM host mode.

- Run direct MCP tests (deterministic):
  ```bash
  yarn test:mcp:direct
  ```
- Run Gemini-based MCP host evals:
  ```bash
  export GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY="<your-gemini-key>"
  export LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN="<your-localstack-auth-token>"
  yarn test:mcp:evals
```
- Open the latest MCP Server Tester HTML report:
  ```bash
  npx mcp-server-tester open
  ```
- Run both:
  ```bash
  yarn test:mcp
  ```

Notes:

- MCP tests target the local STDIO server command `node dist/stdio.js` by default.
- `LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN` is required for all MCP tool usage and test suites.
- You can override the target command with:
  - `MCP_TEST_COMMAND`
  - `MCP_TEST_ARGS` (space-separated arguments)
