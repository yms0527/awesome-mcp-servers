## How to contribute

### Using GitHub Issues

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and enhancements. If you have a general usage
question, please ask in the #mcp-servers channel of the
[Stacklok Discord server](https://discord.gg/stacklok).

If you are reporting a bug, please help to speed up problem diagnosis by
providing as much information as possible. Ideally, that would include a small
sample project that reproduces the problem.

### Not sure how to start contributing?

PRs to resolve existing issues are greatly appreciated and issues labeled as
["good first issue"](https://github.com/StacklokLabs/mkp/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
are a great place to start!
