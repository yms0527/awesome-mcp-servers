"""Unified SQL tool for the AWS Billing and Cost Management MCP server.

This module provides a unified interface for executing SQL queries against
session data, including AWS API results stored in SQLite.

Updated to use shared utility functions.

This tool queries tables created by other tools (like cost_explorer_sql) within the current session.
All tools share the same database, allowing cross-tool data analysis and joins.

Use this tool to:
- Query tables created by cost_explorer_sql and other tools
- Join data from multiple AWS APIs
- Perform complex analysis across different data sources

Common queries:
- SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' -- List all tables
- SELECT * FROM [table_name] LIMIT 10 -- Preview table data""",
