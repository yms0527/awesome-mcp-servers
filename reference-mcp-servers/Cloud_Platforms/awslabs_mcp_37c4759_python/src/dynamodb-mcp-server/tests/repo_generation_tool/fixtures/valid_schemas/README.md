# DynamoDB Schema Design Examples

This directory contains comprehensive examples of both single-table and multi-table DynamoDB schema designs that demonstrate various access patterns, data organization strategies, and real-world application architectures.

## Overview

These examples showcase the schema formats supported by the DynamoDB MCP server code generation system. Each example represents a complete application domain demonstrating different approaches to DynamoDB data modeling - from single table designs optimized for co-location and performance, to multi-table designs optimized for domain separation and complex relationships.

## Schema Format

All examples use the `tables` array format with flexible partition and sort key templates:

```json
{
  "tables": [
    {
      "table_config": {
        "table_name": "TableName",
        "partition_key": "pk",
        "sort_key": "sk"
      },
      "entities": {
        "EntityName": {
          "pk_template": "{field}" | "TENANT#{tenant_id}#USER#{user_id}",
          "pk_params": ["field"] | ["tenant_id", "user_id"],
          "sk_template": "STATIC" | "TYPE#{field}#{timestamp}",
          "sk_params": [] | ["field", "timestamp"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Design Pattern Comparison

### Single Table Design Benefits

- **Cost efficiency**: Single table reduces operational costs and complexity
- **Data co-location**: Related data stored together for optimal performance
- **Atomic transactions**: All related operations can be performed atomically
- **Simplified infrastructure**: One table to manage, monitor, and scale

### Multi-Table Design Benefits

- **Domain separation**: Clear boundaries between different data types
- **Independent scaling**: Each table can be optimized for its specific access patterns
- **Flexible schema evolution**: Changes to one domain don't affect others
- **Specialized indexing**: GSIs can be tailored to specific entity requirements

## Key Patterns Demonstrated

### Single Table Patterns

- **Complex partition keys**: `TENANT#{tenant_id}#USER#{user_id}` for multi-level hierarchy
- **Hierarchical sort keys**: `POST#{post_id}`, `COMMENT#{post_id}#{comment_id}` for logical grouping
- **Type-based organization**: Entity type prefixes for efficient filtering
- **Chronological sorting**: Timestamps embedded in keys for natural ordering

### Multi-Table Patterns

- **Cross-table relationships**: Entity references in access pattern parameters
- **Denormalized data**: Strategic duplication for performance optimization
- **Consistent naming**: Unified conventions across all tables
- **Domain-specific optimization**: Each table optimized for its access patterns

### Advanced DynamoDB Techniques

- **Composite sort keys**: Enable complex sorting and filtering
- **Strategic denormalization**: Performance optimization through data duplication
- **GSI-ready design**: Sort key patterns optimized for Global Secondary Indexes
- **Time-series data**: Efficient storage and retrieval of chronological data
- **Range queries**: Date ranges, time slots, and filtered results

### GSI (Global Secondary Index) Patterns

- **Alternative partition keys**: Enable queries on non-primary key attributes
- **GSI key templates**: Template-based GSI key generation for flexible querying
- **Cross-entity queries**: GSI patterns that span multiple entity types
- **Analytics optimization**: GSI designs optimized for reporting and analytics
- **Query pattern alignment**: GSI structures that match common access patterns

## When to Choose Each Design

### Choose Single Table Design When:

- Related data is frequently accessed together
- You need atomic transactions across related entities
- Cost optimization is a primary concern
- Your access patterns are well-defined and stable
- You want simplified infrastructure management

### Choose Multi-Table Design When:

- You have distinct, independent data domains
- Different entities have vastly different access patterns
- You need to optimize for specific query types per entity
- Your application requires complex cross-entity analytics
- You want maximum flexibility for future schema changes

## Usage Instructions

1. **Choose an example** that matches your domain and access patterns
2. **Study the partition/sort key design** to understand data organization
3. **Review the access patterns** to see query optimization techniques
4. **Examine relationships** (single table hierarchy vs multi-table references)
5. **Consider your scale and cost requirements**
6. **Use as a template** for your own DynamoDB designs

## Code Generation

Each schema can be used with the DynamoDB MCP server code generation system:

```bash
uv run codegen.py --schema path/to/schema.json --language python --output ./generated
```

The generated code will include:

- Entity models with complex key builders (single table) or simple keys (multi-table)
- Repository classes optimized for the chosen design pattern
- Access pattern implementations
- Usage examples demonstrating the specific design approach

## Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Partition key design**: Efficient data distribution and access patterns
2. **Sort key optimization**: Enables range queries and logical organization
3. **Access pattern alignment**: Designed for common query requirements
4. **Strategic denormalization**: Balances consistency with performance
5. **Scalability considerations**: Patterns that work at enterprise scale
6. **Cost optimization**: Efficient use of DynamoDB capacity and features

These examples serve as comprehensive references for building production-ready DynamoDB applications using either single table or multi-table design patterns, each optimized for different use cases and requirements.
