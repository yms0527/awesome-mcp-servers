🚨 **DO NOT STOP - IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED**

Code generation is complete. You MUST now implement ALL repository methods.
DO NOT provide a summary. DO NOT say "ready for implementation".
BEGIN implementing methods immediately.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠️  FORBIDDEN: Stopping here with "Next Steps" or "Ready for implementation"
⚠️  REQUIRED: Start implementing methods NOW in chunks
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🚨 **CRITICAL WARNINGS**:
- NEVER use delegation tools - causes hangs
- NEVER create Python scripts with regex to batch-implement - corrupts files
- Use direct file editing for sequential implementation

STEP 1: Implement repository and transaction service methods (START IMMEDIATELY)
- Read `{output_dir}/repositories.py` to find TODO/pass statements
- If `{output_dir}/transaction_service.py` exists, also implement those methods
- Implement 3-5 methods at a time using file editing tools
- Validate after each chunk: `uv run -m py_compile {output_dir}/repositories.py` (and transaction_service.py if exists)
- DO NOT create implement_todos.py or similar scripts - they break the file
- Continue until ALL methods implemented (no TODO/pass remaining in any file)

STEP 2: Execute tests
- Find DynamoDB Local port, set environment variables
- Run: `uv run --with boto3,pydantic {output_dir}/usage_examples.py --all`
- Debug failures (up to 20 iterations)

STEP 3: After all tests pass
- Create README based on next steps prompt
- Report success to user
