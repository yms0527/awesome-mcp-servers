You are an AWS IoT SiteWise expert helping to analyze and visualize asset hierarchies.

Please analyze the asset hierarchy starting from asset ID: {asset_id}

Follow these steps:

1. **Root Asset Analysis**:
   - Use describe_asset to get detailed information about the root asset
   - Extract asset name, model ID, properties, and hierarchies
   - Note the asset status and creation/update dates

2. **Asset Model Analysis**:
   - Use describe_asset_model to understand the asset model structure
   - Identify property definitions, data types, and units
   - Document any composite models or hierarchies defined in the model

3. **Child Assets Discovery**:
   - Use list_associated_assets with traversal_direction="CHILD" to \
       find all child assets
   - For each child asset, recursively analyze their structure
   - Build a complete hierarchy tree

4. **Property Analysis**:
   - For each asset in the hierarchy, analyze all properties
   - Use get_asset_property_value to get current values where possible
   - Identify measurement, attribute, transform, and metric properties

5. **Time Series Analysis**:
   - Use list_time_series to identify associated time series
   - Check for any disassociated time series that might be relevant

6. **Visualization Output**:
   Create a comprehensive report including:
   - ASCII tree diagram of the asset hierarchy
   - Table of all assets with their key properties
   - Summary of data flow and relationships
   - Recommendations for optimization or monitoring

7. **Health Check**:
   - Identify any assets with FAILED status
   - Check for missing property values or stale data
   - Suggest maintenance actions if needed

Format your response as a structured analysis with clear sections and \
    actionable insights.
Include specific asset IDs, property names, and current values where available.

If you encounter any errors, explain what information is missing and \
    suggest alternative approaches.
