# Amazon ECS MCP Server

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/awslabs.ecs-mcp-server.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/awslabs.ecs-mcp-server/)

An MCP server for containerizing applications, deploying applications to Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), troubleshooting ECS deployments, and managing ECS resources. This server enables AI assistants to help users with the full lifecycle of containerized applications on AWS.

> **Note:** AWS offers a fully managed Amazon ECS MCP server that provides enterprise-grade capabilities including automatic updates, centralized security through IAM integration, comprehensive audit logging via CloudTrail, and the proven scalability and reliability of AWS. The managed service eliminates the need for local installation and maintenance. [Learn more about the managed Amazon ECS MCP server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-mcp-introduction.html).

## Features

- **Containerization Guidance**: Provides best practices and guidance for containerizing web applications
- **ECS Express Mode Deployment**: Deploy containerized applications using ECS Express Mode with automatic infrastructure provisioning
- **ECR Integration**: Automated ECR repository creation and Docker image builds with push to ECR
- **Load Balancer Integration**: Automatically configure Application Load Balancers (ALBs) with HTTPS support
- **Auto-scaling**: Built-in auto-scaling with configurable CPU/memory and scaling targets
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Generate and apply CloudFormation templates for ECR and ECS infrastructure
- **URL Management**: Return public ALB URLs for immediate access to deployed applications
- **Circuit Breaker**: Implement deployment circuit breaker with automatic rollback
- **Container Insights**: Enable enhanced container insights for monitoring
- **Security Best Practices**: Implement AWS security best practices for container deployments
- **Resource Management**: List and explore ECS resources such as task definitions, services, clusters, and tasks
- **AWS Knowledge Integration**: Access up-to-date AWS documentation through the integrated AWS Knowledge MCP Server proxy which includes knowledge on ECS and new features released that models may not be aware of

Customers can use the `containerize_app` tool to help them containerize their applications with best practices. The `build_and_push_image_to_ecr` tool creates ECR infrastructure and pushes Docker images. The `validate_ecs_express_mode_prerequisites` tool validates that all required IAM roles and images exist before deployment. Customers deploy using `ecs_resource_management` with the `CreateExpressGatewayService` operation for Express Mode deployments. The `wait_for_service_ready` tool helps track deployment progress, and `delete_app` provides complete cleanup of Express Mode deployments.

Customers can list and view their ECS resources (clusters, services, tasks, task definitions) and access their ECR resources (container images) using the `ecs_resource_management` tool. When running into ECS deployment issues, they can use the `ecs_troubleshooting_tool` to diagnose and resolve common problems.

## Installation

### Option 1 (Recommended): Hosted MCP Server

Use the AWS-managed ECS MCP Server for simplified setup and automatic updates. The hosted service eliminates local installation requirements and provides enterprise-grade security through AWS IAM integration.

For complete setup instructions, configuration examples, and IAM permissions, see the [Amazon ECS MCP Server documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-mcp-getting-started.html).

### Option 2: Local MCP Server (Legacy)

> **Note**: This is the legacy local installation method that will no longer receive updates. We recommend using [Option 1 (Hosted MCP Server)](#option-1-recommended-hosted-mcp-server) instead.

#### Prerequisites

Before installing the ECS MCP Server, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

1. **Docker or Finch**: Required for containerization and local testing
   - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for container management
   - [Finch](https://github.com/runfinch/finch) as a Docker alternative

2. **UV**: Required for package management and running MCP servers
   - Install `uv` from [Astral](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

#### Installation Steps

```bash
# Install using uv
uv pip install awslabs.ecs-mcp-server

# Or install using pip
pip install awslabs.ecs-mcp-server
```

You can also run the MCP server directly from a local clone of the GitHub repository:

```bash
# Clone the awslabs repository
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/mcp.git

# Run the server directly using uv
uv --directory /path/to/ecs-mcp-server/src/ecs-mcp-server/awslabs/ecs_mcp_server run main.py
```

To setup your preferred MCP client (ie. Kiro, Cline, Cursor, VS Code, etc.) with the ECS MCP Server, proceed to the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

## Usage Environments

The ECS MCP Server is currently in development and is designed for the following environments:

- **Development and Prototyping**: Ideal for local application development, testing containerization approaches, and rapidly iterating on deployment configurations.
- **Learning and Exploration**: Excellent for users who want to learn about containerization, ECS, and AWS infrastructure.
- **Testing and Staging**: Suitable for integration testing and pre-production validation in non-critical environments.

**Not Recommended For**:
- **Production Workloads**: As this tool is still in active development, it is not suited for production deployments or business-critical applications.
- **Regulated or Sensitive Workloads**: Not suitable for applications handling sensitive data or subject to regulatory compliance requirements.

**Important Note on Troubleshooting Tools**: Even the troubleshooting tools should be used with caution in production environments. Always set `ALLOW_SENSITIVE_DATA=false` and `ALLOW_WRITE=false` flags when connecting to production accounts to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information or unintended infrastructure modifications.

## Production Considerations

While the ECS MCP Server is primarily designed for development, testing, and non-critical environments, certain components can be considered for controlled production use with appropriate safeguards.

### Allowlisted Actions for Production

The following operations are read-only and relatively safe for production environments when used with appropriate IAM permissions. Note: they can return sensitive information, so ensure `ALLOW_SENSITIVE_DATA=false` is set in production configurations.

| Tool | Operation | Production Safety |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| `ecs_resource_management` | List operations (clusters, services, tasks) | ✅ Safe - Read-only |
| `ecs_resource_management` | Describe operations (clusters, services, tasks) | ✅ Safe - Read-only |
| `validate_ecs_express_mode_prerequisites` | Prerequisite validation | ✅ Safe - Read-only |
| `wait_for_service_ready` | Service readiness polling | ✅ Safe - Read-only |
| `ecs_troubleshooting_tool` | `fetch_service_events` | ✅ Safe - Read-only |
| `ecs_troubleshooting_tool` | `get_ecs_troubleshooting_guidance` | ✅ Safe - Read-only |
| `aws_knowledge_aws___search_documentation` | AWS documentation search | ✅ Safe - Read-only |
| `aws_knowledge_aws___read_documentation` | AWS documentation reading | ✅ Safe - Read-only |
| `aws_knowledge_aws___recommend` | AWS documentation recommendations | ✅ Safe - Read-only |

The following operations modify resources and should be used with extreme caution in production:

| Tool | Operation | Production Safety |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| `build_and_push_image_to_ecr` | Build and push Docker images | ⚠️ High Risk - Creates ECR repo, builds/pushes images |
| `delete_app` | Delete Express Mode deployment & ECR infrastructure | 🛑 Dangerous - Deletes resources |
| `containerize_app` | Generate container configs | 🟡 Medium Risk - Local changes only |
| `ecs_resource_management` | Create operations (clusters, services, tasks) | ⚠️ High Risk - Creates resources |
| `ecs_resource_management` | Update operations (services, tasks, settings) | ⚠️ High Risk - Modifies resources |
| `ecs_resource_management` | Delete operations (clusters, services, tasks) | 🛑 Dangerous - Deletes resources |
| `ecs_resource_management` | Run/Start/Stop task operations | ⚠️ High Risk - Affects running workloads |

### When to Consider Production Use

The ECS MCP Server may be appropriate for production environments in the following scenarios:

1. **Read-only monitoring**: Using resource management tools with read-only IAM policies
2. **Troubleshooting non-critical issues**: Using diagnostic tools to gather logs and status information
3. **Sandbox or isolated environments**: Using deployment tools in production-like environments that are isolated from core services

### When to Avoid Production Use

Avoid using ECS MCP Server in production for:

1. Critical business infrastructure
2. Applications handling sensitive customer data
3. High-throughput or high-availability services
4. Regulated workloads with compliance requirements
5. Infrastructure lacking proper backup and disaster recovery procedures

Add the ECS MCP Server to your MCP client configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "awslabs.ecs-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "awslabs-ecs-mcp-server", "ecs-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "AWS_PROFILE": "your-aws-profile", // Optional - uses your local AWS configuration if not specified
        "AWS_REGION": "your-aws-region", // Optional - uses your local AWS configuration if not specified
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR",
        "FASTMCP_LOG_FILE": "/path/to/ecs-mcp-server.log",
        "ALLOW_WRITE": "false",
        "ALLOW_SENSITIVE_DATA": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
### Windows Installation

For Windows users, the MCP server configuration format is slightly different:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "awslabs.ecs-mcp-server": {
      "disabled": false,
      "timeout": 60,
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "tool",
        "run",
        "--from",
        "awslabs.ecs-mcp-server@latest",
        "ecs-mcp-server.exe"
      ],
     "env": {
        "AWS_PROFILE": "your-aws-profile", // Optional - uses your local AWS configuration if not specified
        "AWS_REGION": "your-aws-region", // Optional - uses your local AWS configuration if not specified
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR",
        "FASTMCP_LOG_FILE": "/path/to/ecs-mcp-server.log",
        "ALLOW_WRITE": "false",
        "ALLOW_SENSITIVE_DATA": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```


If running from a local repository, configure the MCP client like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "awslabs.ecs-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/ecs-mcp-server/src/ecs-mcp-server/awslabs/ecs_mcp_server",
        "run",
        "main.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "AWS_PROFILE": "your-aws-profile",
        "AWS_REGION": "your-aws-region",
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "DEBUG",
        "FASTMCP_LOG_FILE": "/path/to/ecs-mcp-server.log",
        "ALLOW_WRITE": "false",
        "ALLOW_SENSITIVE_DATA": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Updating the MCP Server

The ECS MCP Server is regularly updated with new features, bug fixes, and improvements. Here's how to get the latest updates:

### Automatic Updates (Default Behavior)

If you installed via PyPI (recommended), updates are automatic:

- **PyPI Installation**: The MCP client automatically downloads the latest version when the server is restarted
- **No action required**: Simply restart your MCP client to get the latest updates

### Manual Updates

If you want to manually update to ensure you have the latest version:

```bash
uv pip install --upgrade awslabs.ecs-mcp-server
```

### Local Repository Updates

If you're running from a cloned repository, update by pulling the latest changes:

```bash
# Navigate to your cloned repository
cd /path/to/mcp

# Pull the latest changes
git pull origin main

# The MCP server will automatically use the updated code on next restart
```

## Security Controls

The ECS MCP Server includes security controls in your MCP client configuration to prevent accidental changes to infrastructure and limit access to sensitive data:

### ALLOW_WRITE

Controls whether write operations (creating or deleting infrastructure) are allowed.

```bash
# Enable write operations
"ALLOW_WRITE": "true"

# Disable write operations (default)
"ALLOW_WRITE": "false"
```

### ALLOW_SENSITIVE_DATA

Controls whether tools that return logs and detailed resource information are allowed.

```bash
# Enable access to sensitive data
"ALLOW_SENSITIVE_DATA": "true"

# Disable access to sensitive data (default)
"ALLOW_SENSITIVE_DATA": "false"
```

### IAM Best Practices

We strongly recommend creating dedicated IAM roles with least-privilege permissions when using the ECS MCP Server:

1. **Create a dedicated IAM role** specifically for ECS MCP Server operations
2. **Apply least-privilege permissions** by attaching only the necessary policies based on your use case
3. **Use scoped-down resource policies** whenever possible
4. **Apply a permission boundary** to limit the maximum permissions

For detailed example IAM policies tailored for different ECS MCP Server use cases (read-only monitoring, troubleshooting, deployment, and service-specific access), see [EXAMPLE_IAM_POLICIES.md](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp/blob/main/src/ecs-mcp-server/EXAMPLE_IAM_POLICIES.md).


## MCP Tools

### Express Mode Deployment Tools

These tools provide end-to-end support for containerizing and deploying applications using ECS Express Mode, which automatically provisions all required infrastructure.

- **containerize_app**: Generates Dockerfile and container configurations for web applications with best practices
- **build_and_push_image_to_ecr**: Creates ECR infrastructure and builds/pushes Docker images
  - Creates ECR repository via CloudFormation
  - Creates IAM role with ECR push/pull permissions
  - Builds Docker image from your application directory
  - Pushes image to ECR with configurable tags
  - Returns `full_image_uri` for use in deployment
- **validate_ecs_express_mode_prerequisites**: Validates prerequisites before Express Mode deployment
  - Checks Task Execution Role exists (defaults to `ecsTaskExecutionRole`)
  - Checks Infrastructure Role exists (defaults to `ecsInfrastructureRoleForExpressServices`)
  - Verifies Docker image exists in ECR
- **wait_for_service_ready**: Polls service status until tasks reach RUNNING state
  - Checks every 10 seconds for running tasks
- **delete_app**: Deletes complete Express Mode deployment
  - Deletes Express Gateway Service and provisioned infrastructure
  - Deletes ECR CloudFormation stack (repository + IAM role)

### Troubleshooting Tool

The troubleshooting tool helps diagnose and resolve common ECS deployment issues stemming from infrastructure, service, task, and network configuration.

- **ecs_troubleshooting_tool**: Consolidated tool with the following actions:
  - **get_ecs_troubleshooting_guidance**: Initial assessment and troubleshooting path recommendation
  - **fetch_cloudformation_status**: Infrastructure-level diagnostics for CloudFormation stacks
  - **fetch_service_events**: Service-level diagnostics for ECS services
  - **fetch_task_failures**: Task-level diagnostics for ECS task failures
  - **fetch_task_logs**: Application-level diagnostics through CloudWatch logs
  - **detect_image_pull_failures**: Specialized tool for detecting container image pull failures
  - **fetch_network_configuration**: Network-level diagnostics for ECS deployments including VPC, subnets, security groups, and load balancers

### Resource Management

This tool provides comprehensive access to Amazon ECS resources to help you monitor, understand, and manage your deployment environment.

- **ecs_resource_management**: Execute operations on ECS resources with a consistent interface:
  - **Read Operations** (always available):
    - Express Gateway Services: List and describe Express Gateway Services
    - Clusters: List all clusters, describe specific cluster details
    - Services: List services in a cluster, describe service configuration
    - Tasks: List running or stopped tasks, describe task details and status
    - Task Definitions: List task definition families, describe specific task definition revisions
    - Container Instances: List container instances, describe instance health and capacity
    - Capacity Providers: List and describe capacity providers associated with clusters
    - Service Deployments: Describe and list service deployments
    - ECR repositories and container images
  - **Write Operations** (requires ALLOW_WRITE=true):
    - Express Mode: Create, update, delete Express Gateway Services
    - Create resources: Create clusters, services, task sets, and capacity providers
    - Update resources: Update service configurations, task protection settings, and cluster settings
    - Delete resources: Delete clusters, services, task definitions, and capacity providers
    - Register/Deregister: Register and deregister task definitions and container instances
    - Task Management: Run tasks, start tasks, stop tasks, and execute commands on running tasks
    - Tag Management: Tag and untag resources

The resource management tool enforces permission checks for write operations. Operations that modify resources require the ALLOW_WRITE environment variable to be set to true.

### AWS Documentation Tools

The ECS MCP Server integrates with the [AWS Knowledge MCP Server](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp/tree/main/src/aws-knowledge-mcp-server) to provide access to up-to-date AWS documentation, including ECS-specific knowledge about new features recently launched that models may not be aware of.

Note: these tools are duplicative if you have the AWS Knowledge MCP Server already configured in your MCP client. For the below knowledge tools, the ECS MCP Server adds extra guidance to the tool descriptions to help LLMs use the tools for ECS contexts.

- **aws_knowledge_aws___search_documentation**: Search across all AWS documentation including the latest AWS docs, API references, Blogs posts, Architectural references, and Well-Architected best practices.

- **aws_knowledge_aws___read_documentation**: Fetch and convert AWS documentation pages to markdown format.

- **aws_knowledge_aws___recommend**: Get content recommendations for AWS documentation pages.
