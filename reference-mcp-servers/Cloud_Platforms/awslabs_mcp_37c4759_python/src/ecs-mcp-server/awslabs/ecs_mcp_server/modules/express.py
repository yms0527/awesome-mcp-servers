        Creates ECR infrastructure and builds/pushes a Docker image to ECR.

        This tool automates the complete ECR setup and image deployment process:
        1. Creates ECR repository via CloudFormation
        2. Creates IAM role with ECR push/pull permissions
        3. Builds Docker image from your application
        4. Pushes image to ECR

        ## Parameters:
        - Required: app_name (Application name, 1-20 chars, lowercase letters/digits/hyphens only)
        - Required: app_path (Path to application directory with Dockerfile)
        - Optional: tag (Image tag, defaults to epoch timestamp)

        ## Prerequisites:
        - Docker installed and running locally
        - Dockerfile exists in the application directory
        - AWS credentials configured with appropriate permissions

        ## Returns:
        Dictionary containing:
        - repository_uri: ECR repository URI
        - image_tag: The tag of the pushed image
        - full_image_uri: Complete image URI with tag (use this for deployment)
        - ecr_push_pull_role_arn: ARN of the IAM role created for ECR access
        - stack_name: Name of the CloudFormation stack created

        Validates prerequisites for ECS Express Mode deployment.

        This tool checks that all required resources exist and are properly configured
        before deploying an ECS Express Gateway Service.

        ## Validation Checks:
        1. Task Execution Role exists (checks default 'ecsTaskExecutionRole' if not provided)
        2. Infrastructure Role exists (checks default 'ecsInfrastructureRoleForExpressServices'
           if not provided)
        3. Docker image exists in the specified ECR repository

        - Required: image_uri (Full ECR image URI including tag)
        - Optional: execution_role_arn (ARN of task execution role,
          defaults to 'ecsTaskExecutionRole')

          defaults to 'ecsInfrastructureRoleForExpressServices')

        ## Required IAM Roles:

        ### Task Execution Role:
        - Allows ECS tasks to pull images and write logs
        - Must have trust policy for ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com

        - Required: service_arn (ARN of Express Gateway Service)
        - Required: app_name (Application name used during deployment)

        ## What Gets Deleted:
        - Express Gateway Service and all provisioned infrastructure
          (ALB, target groups, security groups)
        - CloudFormation stack for ECR resources, including ECR repo and container images

        ## Important Notes:
        - This operation requires WRITE permission (ALLOW_WRITE=true)
        - Deletion is irreversible - all container images will be deleted
        - Service deletion may take a few minutes as infrastructure is deprovisioned
        - If errors occur, partial deletion is possible (check summary for details)
