## Unreleased
  - **File Path & S3 URI Content Resolution**: Added shared content resolution utility enabling MCP tools to accept local file paths and S3 URIs as alternatives to inline content
    - New `content_resolver.py` utility with automatic detection of input type (local file, S3 URI, or inline content)
    - `lint_workflow_definition` and `lint_workflow_bundle` now accept local file paths and S3 URIs
    - `package_workflow` now accepts local file paths and S3 URIs for main file and additional files
    - New `definition_source` parameter in `create_workflow` and `create_workflow_version` replacing deprecated `definition_zip_base64`
    - `definition_zip_base64` retained as deprecated alias for backward compatibility
    - Security hardening: path traversal rejection, S3 URI format validation, configurable file size limits
