> **⚠️ DEPRECATION NOTICE**: This server is deprecated and will no longer receive updates. Please use [HashiCorp's official Terraform MCP Server](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-mcp-server) instead, which provides comprehensive Terraform Registry lookups, HCP Terraform workspace management, and enterprise-grade features. See the [migration guide](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp/blob/main/docs/migration-terraform.md) for a detailed mapping of tools and known gaps (Terragrunt, Checkov, AWSCC guidance).

Configure the MCP server in your MCP client configuration (e.g., for Kiro, edit `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "awslabs.terraform-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["awslabs.terraform-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```
### Windows Installation

For Windows users, the MCP server configuration format is slightly different:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "awslabs.terraform-mcp-server": {
      "disabled": false,
      "timeout": 60,
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "tool",
        "run",
        "--from",
        "awslabs.terraform-mcp-server@latest",
        "awslabs.terraform-mcp-server.exe"
      ],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR",
        "AWS_PROFILE": "your-aws-profile",
        "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```


or docker after a successful `docker build -t awslabs/terraform-mcp-server .`:

```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "awslabs.terraform-mcp-server": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "--rm",
          "--interactive",
          "--env",
          "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL=ERROR",
          "awslabs/terraform-mcp-server:latest"
        ],
        "env": {},
        "disabled": false,
        "autoApprove": []
      }
    }
  }
```

## Security Considerations

When using this MCP server, you should consider:
- **Following the structured development workflow** that integrates validation and security scanning
- Reviewing all Checkov warnings and errors manually
- Fixing security issues rather than ignoring them whenever possible
- Documenting clear justifications for any necessary exceptions
- Using the RunCheckovScan tool regularly to verify security compliance
- Preferring the AWSCC provider for its consistent API behavior and better security defaults

Before applying Terraform changes to production environments, you should conduct your own independent assessment to ensure that your infrastructure would comply with your own specific security and quality control practices and standards, as well as the local laws, rules, and regulations that govern you and your content.
