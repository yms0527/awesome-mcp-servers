    Use this tool when:
    - Discovering VPN connections for hybrid connectivity troubleshooting
    - Analyzing VPN tunnel status and configuration
    - Identifying VPN connections attached to Transit Gateways or Virtual Private Gateways
    - Investigating connectivity issues between on-premises and AWS
    - Auditing VPN infrastructure in a region

    Returns comprehensive VPN details including:
    - VPN connection ID, state, and type
    - Customer Gateway and Virtual Private Gateway/Transit Gateway associations
    - Tunnel status and configuration (excludes sensitive CustomerGatewayConfiguration)
    - BGP ASN and routing information
    - Tags and metadata

    Common troubleshooting workflow:
    1. List VPN connections to identify relevant VPN
    2. Check tunnel status (UP/DOWN) for connectivity issues
    3. Verify Transit Gateway or VGW attachments
    4. Cross-reference with Transit Gateway routes or VPC route tables

    Note: CustomerGatewayConfiguration is excluded from results for security.
