    """Get comprehensive Cloud WAN routing tables across all segments and regions.

    Use this tool when:
    - Analyzing complete Cloud WAN routing architecture across all segments
    - Troubleshooting connectivity issues requiring full routing visibility
    - Validating routing configuration after policy changes
    - Comparing routes across multiple segments and regions simultaneously
    - Auditing routing state for documentation or compliance

    When NOT to use:
    - For targeted route lookups in a specific segment/region (use get_cloudwan_routes instead)
    - When output size is a concern and you only need subset of routes
    - For initial exploration (start with get_cloudwan_details first)

    This tool retrieves routing information for every segment in every Cloud WAN edge location,
    providing a complete view of the network's routing state. Output can be extensive for
    large deployments with many segments and routes.

    Returns:
        dict: Complete routing tables organized by region and segment, including:
            - core_network_id: The Cloud WAN core network identifier
            - regions: Dict keyed by edge location containing:
                - segments: Dict keyed by segment name containing:
                    - routes: List of route entries with destination, target, type, and state

    Example workflow:
    1. Call get_cloudwan_details() to understand network structure
    2. Use this tool for comprehensive routing analysis
    3. Use get_cloudwan_routes() for focused segment-specific queries
