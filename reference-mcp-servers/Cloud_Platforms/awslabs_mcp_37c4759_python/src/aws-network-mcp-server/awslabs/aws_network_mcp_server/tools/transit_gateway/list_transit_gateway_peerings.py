    Use this tool when:
    - Investigating connectivity between Transit Gateways in different regions or accounts
    - Analyzing Transit Gateway to Cloud WAN Core Network connections
    - Troubleshooting cross-region or cross-account routing issues
    - Validating peering attachment states and configurations
    - Mapping network topology across multiple Transit Gateways

    This tool retrieves all peering attachments for a specified Transit Gateway,
    including peerings to other Transit Gateways and Cloud WAN Core Networks.
    Each peering includes state, requester/accepter details, and attachment metadata.

    Common troubleshooting scenarios:
    - "Why can't traffic flow between two Transit Gateways?"
    - "Is my Transit Gateway properly peered with Cloud WAN?"
    - "What peering connections exist for this Transit Gateway?"

    Returns:
        List of peering attachments with details including:
        - TransitGatewayAttachmentId: Unique peering attachment identifier
        - State: Current state (available, pending, deleting, etc.)
        - RequesterTgwInfo: Source Transit Gateway details (ID, region, account)
        - AccepterTgwInfo: Destination Transit Gateway details
        - CreationTime: When the peering was created
        - Tags: Resource tags for identification
