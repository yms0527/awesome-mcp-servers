    """Simulate Cloud WAN network changes for a single region. Provide list of attachment IDs and the segments where to put them.

    This script will get the active route tables from Cloud WAN for single region and then simulate how the route tables would look like when attachemnt routes are changed.

    RELATED TOOLS:
        - Use get_cloudwan_details() first to understand current state
        - Use get_cloud_wan_routes() to see current routing
        - Use find_cloudwan_vpc_attachment() to identify attachment segments

    SIMULATION WORKFLOW:
        1. Get current state with get_cloudwan_details()
        2. Run simulation with this tool
        3. Compare 'before' and 'after' route tables

    Provide only the attachment id to simulate a scenario where the attachment is completely removed.
