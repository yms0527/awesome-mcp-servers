    """List all VPCs in the specified AWS region.

    Use this tool when:
    - Starting network troubleshooting to identify available VPCs
    - Discovering VPC infrastructure before detailed analysis
    - Finding VPC IDs needed for other tools like get_vpc_network_details()
    - Auditing VPC inventory across regions
    - Locating VPCs by name or CIDR block from tags

    Common workflows:
    1. List VPCs → Identify target VPC → get_vpc_network_details() for routing/security
    2. List VPCs → Find VPC with specific CIDR → get_vpc_flow_logs() for traffic analysis
    3. List VPCs → Identify Transit Gateway attachments → get_tgw_details()

    Returns:
        Dict containing:
        - vpcs: List of VPC objects with ID, CIDR blocks, state, tags, and attributes
        - region: AWS region queried
        - total_count: Number of VPCs found

    Each VPC includes:
    - VpcId: Unique identifier for use with other tools
    - CidrBlock: Primary IPv4 CIDR range
    - State: VPC state (available, pending)
    - Tags: Name and custom tags for identification
    - IsDefault: Whether this is the default VPC
