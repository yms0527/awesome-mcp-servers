    """Get comprehensive VPC network configuration including routing, subnets, security, and connectivity.

    Use this tool when:
    - Troubleshooting connectivity issues within a VPC
    - Analyzing why traffic cannot reach the internet or specific destinations
    - Understanding the network topology and routing paths
    - Investigating security group or NACL blocking issues
    - Validating VPC endpoint configurations
    - Mapping out subnet associations and route table assignments

    Required parameters:
    - vpc_id: The VPC identifier (e.g., vpc-0123456789abcdef0)
    - region: AWS region where the VPC exists (e.g., us-east-1, eu-west-1)

    Returns comprehensive VPC details:
    - VPC CIDR blocks and basic configuration
    - Route tables with all routes and subnet associations
    - Subnets with CIDR blocks, availability zones, and route table mappings
    - Internet gateways attached to the VPC
    - NAT gateways for private subnet internet access
    - Network ACLs with inbound/outbound rules
    - VPC endpoints for AWS service connectivity

    Common troubleshooting workflows:
    1. Internet connectivity: Check for internet gateway, route to 0.0.0.0/0, and NACL rules
    2. Subnet isolation: Verify route tables and NACL rules between subnets
    3. AWS service access: Confirm VPC endpoints exist for required services
    4. NAT gateway issues: Validate NAT gateway state and routing from private subnets

    Example scenarios:
    - "EC2 instance can't reach internet" → Check IGW attachment, route table 0.0.0.0/0 route, NACL egress
    - "Can't connect between subnets" → Verify route tables allow local routing, check NACL rules
    - "S3 access failing" → Look for S3 VPC endpoint or NAT gateway for internet path

    Note: This tool provides network configuration only. For traffic flow validation, use get_vpc_flow_logs.
    For security group rules on specific instances, use get_eni_details.
