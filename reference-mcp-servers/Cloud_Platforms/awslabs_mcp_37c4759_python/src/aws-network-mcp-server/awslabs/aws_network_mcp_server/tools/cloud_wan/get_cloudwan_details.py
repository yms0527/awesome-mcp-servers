    """Get comprehensive AWS Cloud WAN Core Network configuration and state.

    Use this tool when:
    - Starting Cloud WAN troubleshooting to understand network topology
    - Analyzing routing issues between segments or attachments
    - Validating policy configuration and attachment associations
    - Investigating connectivity problems in multi-region networks
    - Auditing network architecture and attachment states

    This tool retrieves the complete Cloud WAN configuration including core network details,
    live policy document, and all attachments. It's typically the first tool to call when
    troubleshooting Cloud WAN issues.

    Workflow:
    1. Call this tool to get core network overview and policy
    2. Review segments, network function groups, and edges
    3. Examine attachment details to identify relevant VPCs, VPNs, or peerings
    4. Use get_cloudwan_routes() to analyze routing for specific segments
    5. Use detect_cloudwan_inspection() if traffic inspection is involved

    Pagination:
    If next_token is present in the response, call again with the token to retrieve
    additional attachments. When next_token is provided, only attachment data is returned.

    Returns:
        Dict containing:
        - core_network: Core network metadata (segments, edges, ASNs, state)
        - live_policy: Full policy document with segment actions and routing rules
        - attachments: List of all attachments (VPC, VPN, peering, Connect)
        - next_token: Pagination token if more attachments exist (None if complete)
