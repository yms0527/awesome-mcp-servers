        Gets telemetry data for MSK clusters. Current implementation of metrics uses a static table of available metrics.
        Would be better to have a resource to pull this data from and force read it first.

        Args:
            action (str): The operation to perform (metrics, available_metrics)
            cluster_arn (str): The ARN of the cluster (required for cluster operations)
            region (str): AWS region
            kwargs (dict): Additional arguments based on the action type:
                For "metrics" action (ALL of these parameters are REQUIRED):
                    start_time (datetime): Start time for metric data retrieval
                    end_time (datetime): End time for metric data retrieval
                    period (int): The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points
                    metrics (list or dict): REQUIRED. Must be one of:
                        - List of metric names (e.g., ['BytesInPerSec', 'BytesOutPerSec'])
                        - Dictionary mapping metric names to optional statistics
                          (e.g., {'BytesInPerSec': 'Sum', 'BytesOutPerSec': 'Average'})

                        IMPORTANT: A list of dictionaries is NOT supported and will cause an "unhashable type: 'dict'" error.
                        For example, this will NOT work:
                        [{'BytesInPerSec': 'Sum'}, {'BytesOutPerSec': 'Average'}]

                        To specify multiple metrics with different statistics, use a single dictionary:
                        {'BytesInPerSec': 'Sum', 'BytesOutPerSec': 'Average'}

                        To use default statistics for all metrics, use a simple list:
                        ['BytesInPerSec', 'BytesOutPerSec']

                        Note: To specify multiple statistics for the same metric (e.g., both Sum and Average),
                        you need to make separate API calls.

                        The function will validate that metrics is provided and raise an error if missing.
                        If you're unsure which metrics to include, consider using these recommended cluster-level metrics for PROVISONED clusters:

                          **Why these metrics are important:**
                          - **Total Topics (GlobalTopicCount):** Number of topics in the cluster. A rapidly growing topic count can increase metadata overhead and memory usage on brokers. It's useful for capacity planning; extremely large numbers of topics (hundreds or thousands) may impact controller performance.
                          - **Total Partitions (GlobalPartitionCount):** Total count of partitions across all topics. This correlates with broker load (each partition uses memory and file handles). Very high partition counts can strain the cluster (e.g., controller has to manage more metadata, more replication tasks).
                          - **Offline Partitions Count:** Number of partitions without an active leader. This should be 0 in a healthy cluster. A non-zero value means some data is unavailable (likely due to broker failure or insufficient replication). Immediate investigation is needed if >0.
                          - **Under-Replicated Partitions:** Partitions where the replication factor is not currently met (one or more replicas are out of sync). Normally 0. If >0, the cluster is vulnerable to data loss until replicas catch up. Persistent under-replicated partitions indicate a broker down or slow, or network issues hindering replication.
                          - **Connection Count:** Total active connections to brokers (client + inter-broker). Indicates client load. A very high connection count (e.g., thousands of clients) can stress broker networking and memory (each connection uses file descriptors/threads). Monitoring this helps detect surges or leaks in client connections.
                          - **Active Controller Count:** Number of active controllers in the cluster (should be 1). Kafka's controller broker handles admin tasks; there must be exactly one. A value other than 1 indicates an issue (0 means no controller - cluster not operational; >1 is unexpected under normal conditions and could imply a split-brain or ongoing controller election).

                          And these broker-level metrics if per-broker monitoring is enabled:
                          - **BytesInPerSec & BytesOutPerSec:** These measure the incoming and outgoing traffic handled by each broker. They indicate load distribution — if one broker is handling significantly more bytes, it may be doing more work (perhaps hosting more partition leaders or a heavy-topic). High throughput values approach the network or disk I/O limits of the broker's instance.
                          - **UnderReplicatedPartitions:** Per-broker count of partitions for which this broker (as leader) has followers that are not fully caught up. If non-zero on a broker, the partitions it leads are not meeting the replication factor (some follower brokers lagging or down). Ideally 0 for all brokers; a non-zero on any broker is a sign that replication is falling behind for partitions on that broker.
                          - **LeaderCount:** Number of partition leaders on this broker. This shows how partition leadership is distributed. In a balanced cluster, each broker has a similar leader count. If one broker's leader count is much higher, that broker carries more responsibility (all client reads/writes for those partitions go through it). Imbalances can lead to hotspots.
                          - **ProduceTotalTimeMsMean:** The mean time in ms to handle produce (write) requests on this broker. This is an average end-to-end latency for producers interacting with the broker. Higher values mean clients are experiencing slower acknowledgments. It can increase if the broker is overloaded (CPU, I/O) or if there are disk flush bottlenecks.
                          - **FetchConsumerTotalTimeMsMean:** The mean time in ms for consumer fetch requests on this broker. Similarly, it reflects how responsive the broker is to consumer reads. If this climbs, consumers may see increased lag or slower deliveries. Causes include high load, I/O bottlenecks, or network saturation affecting that broker.

                        For SERVERLESS clusters:
                        - **BytesInPerSec:** The number of bytes per second received from clients. This metric is available for each topic.
                        - **BytesOutPerSec:** The number of bytes per second sent to clients. This metric is available for each topic.
                        - **FetchMessageConversionsPerSec:** The number of fetch message conversions per second for the topic.
                        - **MessagesInPerSec:** The number of incoming messages per second for the topic.
                        - **ProduceMessageConversionsPerSec:** The number of produce message conversions per second for the topic.

                    scan_by (str, optional): Scan order for data points ('TimestampDescending' or 'TimestampAscending')
                    label_options (dict, optional): Dictionary containing label options:
                        - timezone: Timezone for labels (e.g., 'UTC', 'US/Pacific')
                    pagination_config (dict, optional): Dictionary containing pagination settings:
                        - MaxItems: Maximum number of items to return
                        - PageSize: Number of items per page
                        - StartingToken: Token for starting position

        Returns:
            dict: Result of the requested operation:
                - For "metrics" action:
                    - MetricDataResults (list): List of metric data results, each containing:
                        - Id (str): The ID of the metric
                        - Label (str): The label of the metric
                        - Timestamps (list): List of timestamps for the data points
                        - Values (list): List of values for the data points
                        - StatusCode (str): The status code of the metric data

                    **How to interpret and use the data:** The tool returns a dictionary of metrics with time-series data (timestamps and values). Key interpretations:
                    - **Interpreting aggregate statistics:** When using the 'Sum' statistic over a period, the value represents the sum across time windows, not the instantaneous value at a given time. To get the average value, divide the sum by the number of data points (which equals the total time span divided by the period parameter in seconds). For example, if Sum=5 over a 5-minute period with period=60 (1-minute data points), this means 5÷(300/60)=5÷5=1 on average. This is especially important for metrics like ActiveControllerCount where the expected value is 1.
                    - **Topics/Partitions:** Gradual increases are normal as you add topics. However, if you notice an unplanned spike, ensure it's expected (maybe a deployment created many topics). Extremely high counts (relative to broker number) might degrade performance; consider adding brokers if partitions per broker count is very high.
                    - **Offline Partitions:** If this is >0 at any time, the cluster has lost leadership for some partitions (likely a broker went down without replica to take over). If partitions remain offline, data for those partitions is unavailable. Investigate broker failures or replication-factor settings (ensure critical topics have replication factor >= 2 or 3).
                    - **Under-Replicated Partitions:** Spikes may occur during broker restarts or network blips, but they should return to 0 quickly. If under-replicated count persists >0 for extended periods, it suggests one or more brokers are not caught up. Identify which broker is lagging or down and resolve (could involve restarting a stuck broker or adding a replacement).
                    - **Connection Count:** This shows total client load. A steadily increasing connection count might indicate new clients or that clients aren't disconnecting properly. If the number is very high, check broker logs or OS limits (each broker has a max connection capacity). Compare with historical norms; sudden large jumps might cause broker strain or require tuning (e.g., increased connection backlog or thread pools).
                    - **Active Controller Count:** Should always be 1. If you see it drop to 0 or spike to 2, it usually means a controller election took place (possibly due to the controller broker failing or restarting). Brief fluctuations from 1 to 0 back to 1 may correspond to a normal failover. Repeated elections (count flipping often) could indicate an unstable controller broker.

                    **Trends and thresholds for cluster-level metrics:**
                    - A growing number of topics/partitions without corresponding increase in resources could eventually saturate broker memory or network. Keep partitions per broker to a reasonable level (there's no hard limit, but thousands of partitions per broker can be problematic).
                    - **Offline Partitions = 0** is the only acceptable steady-state. Alert immediately on any >0.
                    - **Under-Replicated Partitions** should trend back to 0 quickly after any transient issues. Continuous non-zero values (especially increasing) is critical to address (could lead to data loss if another failure occurs).
                    - **Connection Count:** No fixed "max", but track your typical range. If it approaches known limits (for example, if each broker can handle X thousand connections based on instance type), consider scaling or load balancing clients. Spikes might correlate with deploys or client bugs.
                    - **Controller Elections:** If ActiveControllerCount deviates from 1 even briefly, note the time and correlate with broker logs (there will be logs for controller election). Frequent elections (e.g., multiple times a day) are a concern - possibly due to a flapping broker or network issues between brokers.
                    **Trends and thresholds for broker-level metrics:**
                    - **Throughput:** If cluster traffic is increasing, ensure no single broker approaches network saturation (for instance, if an instance type can handle X MB/s, keep an eye if BytesOut on any broker gets close). Sudden throughput imbalance might warrant data redistribution.
                    - **UnderReplicated:** Should normally be 0. Even a small non-zero for extended periods is an alert condition. If under-replication persists on one broker, it may eventually lead to ISR shrink (replica being kicked out) or risk data loss if another failure happens.
                    - **LeaderCount:** Imbalance isn't immediately critical but can cause indirect issues (hotter broker). Aim for leader count to be within a small range across brokers. Large discrepancies might need manual rebalancing.
                    - **Latency metrics:** While exact acceptable values depend on workload, sustained mean latencies above, say, 100-200ms is usually problematic for Kafka (typical operations are faster). If any broker's mean latency jumps significantly relative to its baseline, investigate that broker's health (CPU, memory, garbage collection in logs, etc.). Use these metrics to detect if client-facing performance is degrading at the broker level.
