# MCP Nutanix

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with Nutanix Prism Central APIs through Large Language Models (LLMs).

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL PROJECT**

This project was created as a personal project to explore the capabilities of the Model Context Protocol frameworks in Go. It is:

- **NOT** an official Nutanix product or tool
- **NOT** supported, endorsed, or maintained by Nutanix
- **NOT** suitable for production environments
- **PROVIDED AS-IS** with no warranties or guarantees

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**: The author takes no responsibility for any issues, damages, or outages that may result from using this code.

## Overview

This MCP server allows LLMs to interact with Nutanix Prism Central by:

1. Connecting to a Prism Central instance with user credentials
2. Listing various resources (VMs, Clusters, Hosts, etc.)
3. Retrieving specific resource details via URI-based access

The implementation uses the [Prism Go Client](https://github.com/nutanix-cloud-native/prism-go-client) to communicate with Prism Central and the [MCP Go library](https://github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go) to implement the Model Context Protocol.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.23 or higher
- Access to a Nutanix Prism Central instance
- Tools like `make` and `go fmt` for building

### Building

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/thunderboltsid/mcp-nutanix.git
cd mcp-nutanix

# Build the MCP server
make build
```

## Credential Configuration

The server supports two credential methods:

1. **Interactive credentials** (default) - Works with Claude via MCP prompts
2. **Static credentials** - Required for tools like Cursor that don't support interactive prompts

## MCP Client Configuration

To use this server with MCP clients, you need to configure the client to connect to the server.

### Claude Desktop/Code

Create or update `~/.anthropic/claude_desktop.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nutanix": {
      "command": "/path/to/mcp-nutanix"
    }
  }
}
```

Claude will prompt you for credentials when first using the server.

### Cursor

For Cursor, you need to provide static credentials via environment variables since it doesn't support interactive prompts.

Create or update `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nutanix": {
      "command": "/path/to/mcp-nutanix",
      "env": {
        "NUTANIX_ENDPOINT": "your-prism-central-ip-or-hostname",
        "NUTANIX_USERNAME": "your-username", 
        "NUTANIX_PASSWORD": "your-password",
        "NUTANIX_INSECURE": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Environment Variables:**
- `NUTANIX_ENDPOINT` - Prism Central IP or hostname (required)
- `NUTANIX_USERNAME` - API username (required)
- `NUTANIX_PASSWORD` - API password (required)
- `NUTANIX_INSECURE` - Set to "true" for self-signed certificates (optional)

### Other MCP Clients

This server follows the standard MCP protocol and should work with any MCP client that supports stdio transport. Refer to your client's documentation for configuration instructions.

## Usage

Once the MCP server is configured with your client and connected to your Prism Central instance, LLMs can interact with it through the MCP protocol.

### Resource Listing

To list resources, use the appropriate tool:

```
vms
clusters
hosts
images
subnets
```

The LLM will receive a JSON list of resources that it can parse and analyze.

### Resource Access

To access a specific resource, use a resource URI:

```
vm://{uuid}
cluster://{uuid}
host://{uuid}
```

The LLM will receive detailed JSON information about the specific resource.

### Code Generation

The project uses code generation to create resource and tool handlers. To update these:

```bash
make generate
```

## Limitations

- Response size is limited by the MCP protocol
- Some resources with large response sizes may cause errors
- No pagination support in the current implementation
- Only supports read operations, no create/update/delete
