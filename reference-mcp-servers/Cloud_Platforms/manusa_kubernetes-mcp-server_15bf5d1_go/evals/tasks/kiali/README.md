# Kiali Task Stack

Kiali-focused MCP tasks live here. Each folder under this directory represents a self-contained scenario that exercises the Kiali toolset (Istio config, topology, observability, troubleshooting).

## Adding a New Task

1. Create a new subdirectory (e.g., `status-foo/`) and place the scenario YAML plus any helper scripts or artifacts inside it.
2. Make sure the YAML’s `metadata` block includes `name`, `category`, and `difficulty` so it shows up correctly in the catalog below.
3. Keep prompts concise and action-oriented; verification commands should rely on Kiali MCP tools whenever possible.

## Updating the Catalog

After adding or editing tasks, regenerate this README’s catalog with:

```bash
make update_tasks
```

The `update_tasks` target runs `scripts/update_tasks.sh`, which parses every scenario and rewrites the section below automatically. Always run it before committing so the list stays in sync.
