# End To End (e2e) Tests

The purpose of the E2E tests is to have a simple (currently) test that gives maintainers some confidence when adding new resources/tools. It does this by:
 * Building the `terraform-mcp-server` docker image
 * Running the image
 * Interacting with the server via stdio
 * Issuing requests that interact with the existing Resources/Tools

## Running the Tests

A service must be running that supports image building and container creation via the `docker` CLI.

```
make test-e2e
```

Running the tests:

```
make test-e2e
