# OCI Pricing MCP Server

A [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that provides Oracle Cloud Infrastructure pricing data to AI assistants like Claude.

> **Important Note:** This server provides pricing data from Oracle's public pricing API and bundled data. We cannot guarantee that AI assistants will always interpret pricing correctly or identify the absolute cheapest options. Always verify pricing on [Oracle's official price list](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/price-list/) before making decisions. All API calls are free of charge (no authentication required).

## Why This Exists

AWS, Azure, and GCP all have pricing MCP servers. OCI did not - until now.

| Provider | Pricing MCP | Type |
|----------|-------------|------|
| AWS | [aws-pricing-mcp-server](https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/servers/aws-pricing-mcp-server) | Official |
| Azure | [azure-pricing-mcp](https://github.com/charris-msft/azure-pricing-mcp) | Community |
| GCP | [gcp-cost-mcp-server](https://github.com/nozomi-koborinai/gcp-cost-mcp-server) | Community |
| OCI | **oci-pricing-mcp** | Community |

### Example: "How much does a 4 OCPU, 32GB VM cost on OCI?"

**You ask Claude:**
> What's the monthly cost for a VM with 4 OCPUs and 32GB RAM on OCI?

**Claude responds (using this MCP):**
```
For a VM.Standard.E5.Flex with 4 OCPUs and 32GB RAM:

  OCPU cost:    4 OCPUs × $0.03/hr = $0.12/hr
  Memory cost:  32 GB × $0.002/hr  = $0.064/hr
  Total hourly: $0.184/hr

  Monthly cost (730 hrs): $134.32

For comparison, the Arm-based A1 shape would be significantly cheaper:

  A1 total:     4 × $0.01 + 32 × $0.0015 = $0.088/hr
  Monthly:      $64.24 (52% savings)
```

### Example: "Compare OCI vs AWS for data egress"

**You ask Claude:**
> How much would I save on OCI vs AWS for 5TB of monthly data egress?

**Claude responds (using this MCP):**
```
Data Egress Cost Comparison (5 TB/month):

  OCI:
    First 10 TB free → $0.00

  AWS:
    First 10 GB: free
    Next 9.99 TB @ $0.09/GB → ~$450/month

  Monthly savings with OCI: $450 (100% savings)

OCI includes 10 TB of free outbound data transfer monthly,
making it significantly more cost-effective for data-heavy workloads.
```

## Usage Examples

### Ask Claude about OCI pricing

```
What's the cost of running a VM.Standard.E5.Flex with 4 OCPUs and 32GB RAM?
```

```
Compare OCI block storage tiers for 1TB of data
```

```
Estimate monthly cost for a Kubernetes cluster with 3 nodes
```

```
How much would I save using OCI vs AWS for 5TB of monthly data egress?
```

### Quick Estimates

```
Give me a quick estimate for a small web app on OCI
```

Available presets:
- `small-web-app` - 1 OCPU, 8GB, 100GB storage, LB
- `medium-api-server` - 4 OCPU, 32GB, 500GB storage
- `large-database` - 8 OCPU, 128GB, Autonomous DB
- `ml-training` - 8x A100 GPUs (part-time)
- `kubernetes-cluster` - 3 nodes, 4 OCPU each

## OCI Pricing Highlights

### Key Differentiators

- **Consistent Global Pricing**: Unlike AWS/Azure/GCP, OCI prices are the same across all commercial regions
- **10 TB Free Egress**: First 10 TB of outbound data transfer is free monthly
- **Free Kubernetes Control Plane**: OKE Basic clusters have no management fee
- **Network Load Balancer**: Completely free (no hourly or data charges)
- **Always Free Tier**: Never expires - 4 Arm OCPUs, 24GB RAM, 200GB storage, 2 Autonomous DBs

### Cost-Effective Shapes

| Shape | OCPU Price | Best For |
|-------|------------|----------|
| VM.Standard.A1.Flex (Arm) | $0.01/hr | Best value, Arm workloads |
| VM.Standard.E5.Flex | $0.03/hr | New x86 deployments |
| VM.Standard.E4.Flex | $0.025/hr | Previous gen, still good |

### OCPU vs vCPU

1 OCPU = 2 vCPUs for x86 architectures. OCPUs represent physical cores, so OCI's $0.03/OCPU/hr is equivalent to $0.015/vCPU/hr.

## Data Sources

This MCP server supports two data modes:

### Bundled Data (Default)

Pricing data is synced from Oracle's public pricing API and bundled with the server. This provides fast, offline access to the complete OCI pricing catalog.

- **Products**: 602 SKUs (full API dataset)
- **Categories**: 109 service categories
- **Detailed compute shapes**: 15 curated shapes with OCPU/memory breakdowns
- **Timestamps**: `apiLastUpdated` and `bundledDataGenerated` for verification

### Real-Time API

For the most current pricing between releases, use `fetch_realtime_pricing` which queries Oracle's API directly:

```
https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/cetools/api/v1/products/
```

- **Authentication**: None required (public API)
- **Multi-currency**: USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, AUD, CAD, and more
- **Updates**: Oracle updates pricing data periodically

## FAQ

### Does OCI have a pricing API?

Yes! Oracle provides a public pricing API at `https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/cetools/api/v1/products/` that returns all OCI product pricing in JSON format. No authentication is required. This MCP server uses this API for the `fetch_realtime_pricing` tool.

### Where does the pricing data come from?

- **Bundled data**: Full dataset synced from Oracle's public pricing API and included in the npm package
- **Real-time data**: Fetched directly from Oracle's public pricing API on-demand

### How often is the bundled data updated?

The bundled pricing data is synced from Oracle's API with each npm release. Check `metadata.bundledDataGenerated` for the sync date. Use `fetch_realtime_pricing` between releases to check for updates.

### Why are prices the same across all regions?

Unlike AWS, Azure, and GCP, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure maintains **consistent global pricing** across all commercial regions. This simplifies cost planning and means you can deploy anywhere without price variations.

### What's the difference between OCPU and vCPU?

1 OCPU = 2 vCPUs for x86 architectures. OCPUs represent physical cores with hyper-threading, so OCI's $0.03/OCPU/hr is equivalent to $0.015/vCPU/hr when comparing to AWS/Azure/GCP.

### Can I query my actual OCI spend?

This MCP server provides pricing data, not account spend. For actual usage and spend tracking, you would need to use the OCI Cost Management APIs with proper authentication. This could be added as a future enhancement.

### What's NOT included in the pricing data?

The bundled data includes all 602 products from Oracle's public pricing API. However, some pricing is not available through this API:

- **Committed use discounts** - Only Pay-As-You-Go pricing is shown; annual/3-year commits require Oracle sales
- **Government/sovereign cloud** - Dedicated government regions have separate pricing
- **Oracle SaaS products** - Fusion Apps, NetSuite, etc. are separate from OCI IaaS
- **Custom/negotiated pricing** - Enterprise agreements with volume discounts
- **Support costs** - Premier Support pricing is separate

For these, contact [Oracle Sales](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/contact/) or check the [Oracle Cloud Price List](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/price-list/) directly.

### How do I verify the pricing is accurate?

Each bundled data release includes timestamps:
- `apiLastUpdated`: When Oracle last updated their pricing API
- `bundledDataGenerated`: When this package synced the data

You can verify prices against [Oracle's official price list](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/price-list/) or use the `fetch_realtime_pricing` tool to get live data.
