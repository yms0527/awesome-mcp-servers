### Field Descriptions

#### Instance Family Level Fields

- **Instance Family Name**: The name of the instance family (e.g., "t3a")
- **Current Generation**: Indicates if the instance family is current generation ("Yes") or previous generation ("No")
- **Instance Family**: The AWS classification of the instance family (e.g., "General Purpose", "Compute Optimized")
- **Physical Processor**: The CPU manufacturer and model (e.g., "Intel Xeon Platinum 8175", "AMD EPYC 7R13")
- **Clock Speed**: The processor clock speed in GHz (e.g., 2.5)
- **Processor Features**: Special CPU features or instruction sets (e.g., "AVX, AVX2, Intel AVX-512")
- **Enhanced Networking Supported**: Whether enhanced networking is supported ("Yes" or "No")

#### Instance Size Level Fields

- **Instance Size Name**: The name of the instance size (e.g., "2xlarge")
- **vCPU**: Number of virtual CPUs
- **Memory**: Amount of RAM in GiB
- **Ephemeral Storage**: Amount of instance store storage in GB (0 for EBS-only instances)
- **Network Performance**: Network performance in Mbps
- **Dedicated EBS Throughput**: EBS throughput in Mbps
- **GPU**: Number of GPUs (0 if none)
- **GPU Memory**: Amount of GPU memory in GB (0 if no GPU)

#### Operations and Pricing

The `operations` object contains mappings from operation codes to region-specific pricing. Each region has a comma-separated string of prices with the following positions:

- Position 0: OnDemand price for Shared tenancy
- Position 1: No Upfront 1yr Compute Savings Plan price for Shared tenancy
- Position 2: Partial Upfront 1yr Compute Savings Plan price for Shared tenancy
- Position 3: All Upfront 1yr Compute Savings Plan price for Shared tenancy
- Position 4: No Upfront 3yr Compute Savings Plan price for Shared tenancy
- Position 5: Partial Upfront 3yr Compute Savings Plan price for Shared tenancy
- Position 6: All Upfront 3yr Compute Savings Plan price for Shared tenancy
- Position 7: OnDemand price for Dedicated tenancy
- Position 8: No Upfront 1yr Compute Savings Plan price for Dedicated tenancy
- Position 9: Partial Upfront 1yr Compute Savings Plan price for Dedicated tenancy
- Position 10: All Upfront 1yr Compute Savings Plan price for Dedicated tenancy
- Position 11: No Upfront 3yr Compute Savings Plan price for Dedicated tenancy
- Position 12: Partial Upfront 3yr Compute Savings Plan price for Dedicated tenancy
- Position 13: All Upfront 3yr Compute Savings Plan price for Dedicated tenancy

Empty string values indicate that no pricing is available for that specific combination.
