## How to Add a New Design Decision

1. Create a new file in the `docs/design/` directory following the format:
   - Filename: `YYYYMM-N-short-description.md` (e.g., `202505-1-feature-toggles.md`)
   - Where `YYYYMM` is the date (year-month), and `N` is a sequence number for that date

2. Use the standard template structure:
   ```
   # YYYYMM-N: Title

   **Date**: DD/MM/YYYY

   ### Context
   [Background and reasons for this decision]

   ### Decision
   [The decision that was made]

   ### Rationale
   [Explanation of why this decision was made]

   ### Trade-offs
   [Benefits and challenges of this approach]
   ```

3. Add the decision to the table in this summary document
