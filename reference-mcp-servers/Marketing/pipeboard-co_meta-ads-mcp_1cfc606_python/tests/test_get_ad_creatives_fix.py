"""Regression tests for get_ad_creatives function bug fix.

Tests for issue where get_ad_creatives would throw:
'TypeError: 'dict' object is not callable'

This was caused by trying to call ad_creative_images(creative) where 
ad_creative_images is a dictionary, not a function.

The fix was to create extract_creative_image_urls() function and use that instead.
