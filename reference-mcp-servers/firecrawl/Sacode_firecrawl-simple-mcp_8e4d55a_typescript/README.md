## Available Tools

### 1. Scrape Tool (`firecrawl_scrape`)

Scrape content from a single URL with JavaScript rendering support.

```json
{
  "name": "firecrawl_scrape",
  "arguments": {
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "formats": ["markdown", "html", "rawHtml"],
    "waitFor": 1000,
    "timeout": 30000,
    "includeTags": ["article", "main"],
    "excludeTags": ["nav", "footer"],
    "headers": {

      "Accept-Language": "en-US,en;q=0.9"
    },
    "mobile": false
  }
}
```

Parameters:

- `url` (required): The URL to scrape.
- `formats`: Array of output formats to return. Options include "markdown", "html", and "rawHtml".
- `waitFor`: Time to wait for JavaScript execution in milliseconds.

```json
{
  "name": "firecrawl_map",
  "arguments": {
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "search": "optional search term",
    "ignoreSitemap": true,

  }
}
```

Parameters:

- `url` (required): The URL to map.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors and Solutions

#### Connection Issues

**Error**: `Failed to connect to Firecrawl API at http://localhost:3002/v1`

**Solution**:

- Verify that the Firecrawl Simple API is running
- Check that the API URL is correct, including the `/v1` path
- Ensure there are no network restrictions blocking the connection

#### Authentication Errors

**Error**: `Authentication failed: Invalid API key`

**Solution**:

- Verify that the `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` is correct
- Check if the API requires authentication
- Contact the API administrator for valid credentials

#### Timeout Errors

**Error**: `Request timed out after 30000ms`

**Solution**:

- Increase the `FIRECRAWL_API_TIMEOUT` value
- Check if the target website is slow or unresponsive
- Consider using the `waitFor` parameter to allow more time for JavaScript execution

#### Rate Limiting

**Error**: `Rate limit exceeded`

**Solution**:

- Reduce the frequency of requests
- Implement your own rate limiting strategy
- Contact the API administrator for increased rate limits

#### Invalid URL Errors

**Error**: `Invalid URL format`

**Solution**:

- Ensure the URL includes the protocol (http:// or https://)
- Check for typos in the domain name
- Verify that the URL is accessible in a regular browser

## Note on Crawl Functionality

The crawl functionality has been intentionally removed from this MCP server for the following reasons:

1. **Context Management**: The crawl functionality provides too much information in the context of an MCP server, which can lead to context overflow issues for LLMs. This is because crawling multiple pages generates large amounts of text that would exceed the context limits of most models.

2. **Asynchronous Operation**: Crawling runs asynchronously, which is not ideal for the MCP server architecture that works best with synchronous request-response patterns. The asynchronous nature of crawling makes it difficult to integrate with the synchronous communication model of MCP.

3. **Documentation Alignment**: We've aligned the available tools with the primary documentation to ensure consistency and clarity for users.

If you need website crawling capabilities, consider using the individual scrape tool with multiple targeted URLs or implementing a custom solution outside the MCP server.

## Architecture Improvements

The codebase has been optimized with several key improvements:

### 1. Simplified Service Layer

- Functional approach with reduced duplication.
- Consistent error handling across all service methods.
- Strong input validation using Zod schemas.
- Clear separation of concerns between services and tools.

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

- Centralized error handling utilities.
- Consistent error formatting for better user experience.
- Proper error classification (validation, API, network, timeout).
- Improved error logging with context information.
- User-friendly error messages for LLM consumption.

### 3. Type Safety Improvements

- Eliminated unsafe `any` types.
- Added proper type assertions and validations.
- Consistent return types with proper error flags.
- Zod schema validation for configuration and tool inputs.

### 4. Configuration Management

- Robust environment variable handling with validation.
- Fallback to sensible defaults when configuration is invalid.
- Clear error messages for configuration issues.
- Centralized configuration module.

### 5. Code Organization

- Consistent file and module structure.
- Factory patterns for creating tools and responses.
- Simplified API client usage.
- Better separation of concerns.
