# RAT (Retrieval Augmented Thinking) MCP Tool

## Tool Name
`rat`

## Description
A context-aware reasoning system that orchestrates structured thought processes through dynamic trajectories. Implements iterative hypothesis generation and validation cycles while preserving context coherence across non-linear reasoning paths.

## Installation

### Simple 3-Step Process
```bash
git clone https://github.com/stat-guy/retrieval-augmented-thinking.git
cd retrieval-augmented-thinking
npm install -g .
```

### Verify Installation
Test before configuring Claude Desktop:
```bash
npx mcp-server-rat-node --help
```

**Success indicator:** If you see `RAT MCP Server (Node.js) running on stdio`, installation is complete!

## Claude Desktop Configuration
Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rat": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-rat-node"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after adding the configuration.

## Parameters

  - Primary analysis chains
  - Hypothesis formulation/validation
  - Branch exploration paths
  - Revision proposals
  - Context preservation markers
  - Verification checkpoints

- **`nextThoughtNeeded`** (boolean): Signal for continuation of reasoning chain

## Usage Patterns

### Sequential Analysis
```json
{
  "thought": "First, I need to establish the core problem parameters.",
  "nextThoughtNeeded": true,
  "thoughtNumber": 1,
  "totalThoughts": 5
}
```

### Hypothesis Validation
```json
{
  "thought": "Testing hypothesis: The root cause is data inconsistency.",
  "nextThoughtNeeded": true,
  "thoughtNumber": 3,
  "totalThoughts": 5
}
```

### Revision with Refinement
```json
{
  "thought": "Upon further analysis, the initial assumption was incomplete...",
  "nextThoughtNeeded": true,
  "thoughtNumber": 4,
  "totalThoughts": 5,
  "isRevision": true,
  "revisesThought": 2
}
```

### Branch Exploration
```json
{
  "thought": "Alternative approach: Consider the performance implications...",
  "nextThoughtNeeded": true,
  "thoughtNumber": 3,
  "totalThoughts": 4,
  "branchFromThought": 2,
  "branchId": "performance_analysis"
}
```

### Scope Extension
```json
{
  "thought": "This requires deeper investigation beyond initial scope.",
  "nextThoughtNeeded": true,
  "thoughtNumber": 5,
  "totalThoughts": 5,
  "needsMoreThoughts": true
}
```

## Execution Protocol
1. **Initialize** with scope estimation (`totalThoughts`)
2. **Generate** structured reasoning steps sequentially
3. **Validate** hypotheses through verification cycles
4. **Maintain** context coherence across branches
5. **Implement** revisions through recursive refinement
6. **Signal** completion when validation succeeds

## Best Practices for AI Assistants
- Start with realistic `totalThoughts` estimate (3-7 for most problems)
- Use `isRevision` when refining earlier thoughts
- Create branches for parallel analysis paths
- Extend scope with `needsMoreThoughts` when complexity emerges
- Always provide substantive `thought` content
- Set `nextThoughtNeeded: false` only when reasoning is complete

## Error Prevention
- Ensure `thought` content is non-empty and meaningful
- Keep `thoughtNumber` ≤ `totalThoughts` unless extending scope
- When using `isRevision: true`, always specify `revisesThought`
- When branching, provide both `branchFromThought` and `branchId`
- Use descriptive, analytical language in thought content

## Installation Notes
The installation process includes automatic permission fixes via postinstall scripts. Most users will only need the simple 3-step process. Manual chmod commands are rarely needed as the system handles permissions automatically.
