## Code Review

The diff introduces modularity and improves the structure of the script by encapsulating the model listing logic for each provider into separate functions. However, there are a few issues and areas for improvement.

**Issues, Bugs, and Improvements:**

1.  **🚨 Hardcoded API Key (DeepSeek):** The `list_deepseek_models` function includes a hardcoded API key for DeepSeek. This is a major security vulnerability as API keys should be kept secret and managed securely, preferably through environment variables.

2.  **⚠️ Lack of Error Handling:** The script lacks error handling. If API calls fail due to network issues, invalid API keys, or other reasons, the script will likely crash or produce uninformative error messages.  Robust error handling is crucial for production-ready code.

3.  **ℹ️ Inconsistent API Key Loading (Minor):** While `dotenv` is used for Anthropic and Gemini API keys, OpenAI, Groq, and DeepSeek (partially) rely directly on environment variables.  While functional, consistent use of `dotenv` for all API keys would enhance maintainability and project consistency.

4.  **ℹ️ Missing Function Docstrings (Minor):** The functions lack docstrings explaining their purpose, parameters (if any), and return values. Docstrings enhance code readability and make it easier to understand the function's role.

5.  **ℹ️ No Centralized Configuration (Minor):**  While using environment variables is good, having a more centralized configuration mechanism (even if it's just a `.env` file loaded by `dotenv`) could be beneficial for managing various settings in the future.

|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| 🚨 **Hardcoded API Key (DeepSeek)** | Use environment variables to store and access the DeepSeek API key. | High            |
| ⚠️ **Lack of Error Handling**    | Implement `try-except` blocks to handle potential API errors. | Medium          |
| ℹ️ **Inconsistent API Key Loading** | Use `dotenv` consistently for all API keys.               | Low             |
| ℹ️ **Missing Function Docstrings** | Add docstrings to each function explaining its purpose.   | Low             |
| ℹ️ **No Centralized Config**    | Consider a more centralized configuration approach if needed. | Low             |
