## Schema Validation Rules

### Entity Validation
1. Each entity must have at least one defining property
2. Entity types should not overlap significantly
3. Properties must be relevant to the entity type
4. Names should be unique within their scope

### Relationship Validation
1. Relationships must connect compatible entity types
2. Direction should follow natural semantic flow
3. Properties should provide meaningful context
4. Relationships should avoid circular dependencies where possible

### Graph Structure Rules
1. Graph should remain connected and navigable
2. Avoid isolated subgraphs
3. Maintain reasonable depth and breadth
4. Ensure clear paths between related concepts
