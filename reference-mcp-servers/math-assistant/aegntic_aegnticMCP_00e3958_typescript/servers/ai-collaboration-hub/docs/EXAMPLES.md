## Workflow Patterns

### Iterative Refinement
```python
# Start with broad analysis
session_id = start_collaboration({"max_exchanges": 20})

# Step 1: High-level overview
overview = collaborate_with_gemini({
    "session_id": session_id,
    "content": "Provide a high-level analysis of this system's architecture and identify the top 5 areas that need attention"
})

# Step 2: Deep dive into priority areas
deep_dive = collaborate_with_gemini({
    "session_id": session_id,
    "content": "Let's focus on the database performance issues you mentioned. Provide specific optimization recommendations."
})

# Step 3: Implementation planning
implementation = collaborate_with_gemini({
    "session_id": session_id,
    "content": "Create a step-by-step implementation plan for these database optimizations, including testing strategies."
})
```

### Multi-Perspective Analysis
```python
# Get different viewpoints on the same problem
session_id = start_collaboration({"max_exchanges": 25})

# Technical perspective
technical = collaborate_with_gemini({
    "session_id": session_id,
    "content": "Analyze this from a technical architecture perspective - scalability, performance, maintainability"
})

# Business perspective  
business = collaborate_with_gemini({
    "session_id": session_id,
    "content": "Now analyze the same system from a business perspective - cost, time-to-market, risk factors"
})

# User experience perspective
ux = collaborate_with_gemini({
    "session_id": session_id,
    "content": "Finally, evaluate this from a user experience perspective - usability, accessibility, performance impact"
})
