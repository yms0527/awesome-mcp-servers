### Query Flow Architecture

```mermaid

    USER[User Query] --> PARSER[Query Parser]
    PARSER --> PLANNER[Query Planner]
    PLANNER --> OPTIMIZER[Query Optimizer]
    OPTIMIZER --> EXECUTOR[Query Executor]
    EXECUTOR --> KUZU[(Kuzu Database)]
    KUZU --> RESULTS[Results]
    
    subgraph "Query Processing"
        PARSER --> SYNTAX[Syntax Analysis]
        PLANNER --> STRATEGY[Execution Strategy]
        OPTIMIZER --> INDEXES[Index Selection]
        EXECUTOR --> PARALLEL[Parallel Execution]
    end
    
    RESULTS --> FORMATTER[Result Formatter]
    FORMATTER --> USER
```

### Basic Query Patterns

Let's explore fundamental query patterns:

#### 1. Pattern Matching

```cypher
// Find all memories related to a specific topic
MATCH (m:Memory)-[r:RELATES_TO]->(topic:Memory)
WHERE topic.content CONTAINS 'machine learning'
RETURN m, r, topic
```

#### 2. Path Traversal

```cypher
// Find learning paths between concepts
MATCH path = (start:Memory)-[:BUILDS_ON*1..3]->(end:Memory)
WHERE start.type = 'concept' AND end.type = 'skill'
RETURN path, length(path) as steps
ORDER BY steps
```

#### 3. Aggregation Queries

```cypher
// Count memories by type and tag
MATCH (m:Memory)
UNWIND m.tags as tag
RETURN m.type, tag, count(*) as memory_count
ORDER BY memory_count DESC
```

## 📊 Step 2: Advanced Relationship Analysis

Now let's dive into analyzing the relationships in your knowledge graph.

### Relationship Types and Patterns

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Memory Types"
        FACT[Fact]
        INSIGHT[Insight]
        PROCEDURE[Procedure]
        CONCEPT[Concept]
    end
    
    subgraph "Relationship Types"
        BUILDS[BUILDS_ON]
        RELATES[RELATES_TO]
        CONTRADICTS[CONTRADICTS]
        IMPLEMENTS[IMPLEMENTS]
        SUPERSEDES[SUPERSEDES]
    end
    
    CONCEPT -->|BUILDS_ON| CONCEPT
    FACT -->|RELATES_TO| INSIGHT
    INSIGHT -->|CONTRADICTS| INSIGHT
    PROCEDURE -->|IMPLEMENTS| CONCEPT
    INSIGHT -->|SUPERSEDES| FACT
```

### Creating Complex Relationship Queries

Let's create some advanced relationship queries:

#### 1. Find Knowledge Clusters

```cypher
// Identify tightly connected knowledge clusters
MATCH (m:Memory)-[r]-(connected:Memory)
WITH m, count(connected) as connections
WHERE connections >= 3
MATCH (m)-[r]-(cluster:Memory)
RETURN m.content as center, 
       collect(cluster.content) as connected_memories,
       connections
ORDER BY connections DESC
LIMIT 10
```

#### 2. Discover Learning Dependencies

```cypher
// Find prerequisite chains for learning
MATCH path = (prerequisite:Memory)-[:BUILDS_ON*]->(target:Memory)
WHERE target.content CONTAINS 'advanced'
WITH prerequisite, target, length(path) as depth
ORDER BY depth DESC
RETURN prerequisite.content as start,
       target.content as goal,
       depth as learning_steps
```

#### 3. Identify Knowledge Gaps

```cypher
// Find concepts that lack supporting facts
MATCH (concept:Memory {type: 'concept'})
WHERE NOT (concept)<-[:SUPPORTS]-(fact:Memory {type: 'fact'})
RETURN concept.content as unsupported_concept,
       concept.tags as topics
```

## 🔬 Step 3: Graph Analytics and Insights

Let's perform analytics to discover patterns in your knowledge.

### Knowledge Graph Analytics

```mermaid
graph TD
    ANALYTICS[Graph Analytics] --> CENTRALITY[Centrality Analysis]
    ANALYTICS --> CLUSTERING[Community Detection]
    ANALYTICS --> PATHS[Path Analysis]
    ANALYTICS --> EVOLUTION[Knowledge Evolution]
    
    CENTRALITY --> DEGREE[Degree Centrality]
    CENTRALITY --> BETWEEN[Betweenness Centrality]
    CENTRALITY --> PAGE[PageRank]
    
    CLUSTERING --> MODULARITY[Modularity]
    CLUSTERING --> COMMUNITIES[Community Structure]
    
    PATHS --> SHORTEST[Shortest Paths]
    PATHS --> CRITICAL[Critical Paths]
    
    EVOLUTION --> TEMPORAL[Temporal Analysis]
    EVOLUTION --> GROWTH[Growth Patterns]
```

### Implementing Analytics Queries

#### 1. Find Central Knowledge Nodes

```cypher
// Identify the most connected memories (knowledge hubs)
MATCH (m:Memory)-[r]-(connected:Memory)
WITH m, count(r) as degree
ORDER BY degree DESC
LIMIT 10
RETURN m.content as knowledge_hub,
       m.type as type,
       degree as connections,
       m.tags as topics
```

#### 2. Discover Knowledge Communities

```cypher
// Find groups of related memories
MATCH (m1:Memory)-[r1]-(bridge:Memory)-[r2]-(m2:Memory)
WHERE m1 <> m2
WITH m1, m2, count(bridge) as shared_connections
WHERE shared_connections >= 2
RETURN m1.content as memory1,
       m2.content as memory2,
       shared_connections as strength
ORDER BY strength DESC
```

#### 3. Analyze Knowledge Evolution

```cypher
// Track how knowledge builds over time
MATCH (old:Memory)-[:SUPERSEDES]->(new:Memory)
RETURN old.content as previous_understanding,
       new.content as updated_understanding,
       old.created_at as old_date,
       new.created_at as new_date
ORDER BY new_date DESC
```

## 📈 Step 4: Performance Optimization

Learn how to optimize your graph queries for better performance.

### Query Optimization Strategies

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    QUERY[Original Query] --> ANALYZE[Analyze Performance]
    ANALYZE --> BOTTLENECK{Identify Bottleneck}
    
    BOTTLENECK -->|Scan Heavy| INDEXES[Add Indexes]
    BOTTLENECK -->|Join Heavy| REWRITE[Rewrite Query]
    BOTTLENECK -->|Memory Heavy| LIMIT[Add Limits]
    
    INDEXES --> TEST[Test Performance]
    REWRITE --> TEST
    LIMIT --> TEST
    
    TEST --> MEASURE{Performance OK?}
    MEASURE -->|No| BOTTLENECK
    MEASURE -->|Yes| OPTIMIZED[Optimized Query]
```

### Optimization Techniques

#### 1. Use Indexes Effectively

```cypher
// Create indexes for frequently queried properties
CREATE INDEX ON :Memory(type);
CREATE INDEX ON :Memory(created_at);
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX memory_content FOR (m:Memory) ON EACH [m.content];
```

#### 2. Optimize Query Structure

```cypher
// Instead of this (slow):
MATCH (m:Memory)
WHERE m.content CONTAINS 'search_term'
RETURN m;

// Use this (faster with full-text index):
CALL db.index.fulltext.queryNodes('memory_content', 'search_term')
YIELD node
RETURN node;
```

#### 3. Limit Result Sets

```cypher
// Always use LIMIT for large datasets
MATCH (m:Memory)-[r]->(related:Memory)
RETURN m, r, related
ORDER BY m.created_at DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

## 🎨 Step 5: Graph Visualization Techniques

Learn how to visualize your knowledge graph effectively.

### Visualization Strategies

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Visualization))
    Layout
      Force-directed
      Hierarchical
      Circular
      Grid
    Filtering
      By Type
      By Date
      By Connections
      By Tags
    Styling
      Node Size
      Edge Weight

      Labels
    Interaction
      Zoom/Pan
      Node Selection
      Path Highlighting
      Dynamic Filtering
```

### Creating Visualization Queries

#### 1. Prepare Data for Visualization

```cypher
// Get graph structure for visualization
MATCH (m:Memory)-[r]-(connected:Memory)
RETURN {
  nodes: collect(DISTINCT {
    id: m.id,
    label: substring(m.content, 0, 50),
    type: m.type,
    tags: m.tags,
    size: size((m)-[]-())
  }),
  edges: collect({
    source: m.id,
    target: connected.id,
    type: type(r),
    weight: coalesce(r.strength, 1.0)
  })
}
```

#### 2. Create Filtered Views

```cypher
// Visualize only high-value connections
MATCH (m:Memory)-[r]-(connected:Memory)
WHERE r.strength >= 0.7 OR size((m)-[]-()) >= 5
RETURN m, r, connected
```

## 🔍 Step 6: Advanced Graph Algorithms

Explore sophisticated graph algorithms for knowledge discovery.

```cypher
// Find the shortest path between two concepts
MATCH (start:Memory {content: 'basic programming'}),
      (end:Memory {content: 'advanced algorithms'})
MATCH path = shortestPath((start)-[:BUILDS_ON*]-(end))
RETURN path, length(path) as steps
```

#### 2. Calculate Knowledge Centrality

```cypher
// Find memories that bridge different knowledge domains
MATCH (m:Memory)
MATCH (m)-[r1]-(neighbor1:Memory),
      (m)-[r2]-(neighbor2:Memory)
WHERE neighbor1.tags[0] <> neighbor2.tags[0]
WITH m, count(DISTINCT neighbor1.tags[0]) as domain_connections
WHERE domain_connections >= 3
RETURN m.content as bridge_knowledge,
       domain_connections as domains_connected
ORDER BY domains_connected DESC
```

#### 3. Detect Knowledge Communities

```cypher
// Group memories by shared characteristics
MATCH (m:Memory)
WITH m.tags[0] as primary_tag, collect(m) as memories
WHERE size(memories) >= 3
UNWIND memories as memory
MATCH (memory)-[r]-(related:Memory)
WHERE related.tags[0] = primary_tag
RETURN primary_tag as community,
       count(DISTINCT memory) as community_size,
       count(r) as internal_connections
ORDER BY community_size DESC
```

## 🎯 Step 7: Real-World Analytics Examples

Let's apply what you've learned to practical scenarios.

### Scenario 1: Project Knowledge Audit

```cypher
// Analyze knowledge coverage for a project
MATCH (m:Memory)
WHERE 'project-alpha' IN m.tags

RETURN learning_date, knowledge_type, daily_count,
       sum(daily_count) OVER (
         PARTITION BY knowledge_type 
         ORDER BY learning_date
       ) as cumulative_count
```

### Scenario 3: Knowledge Gap Analysis

```cypher
// Identify areas needing more documentation
MATCH (m:Memory)
UNWIND m.tags as tag
WITH tag, 
     collect(DISTINCT m.type) as types_present,
     count(*) as total_memories
WHERE size(types_present) < 3  // Missing some knowledge types
RETURN tag as topic,
       types_present as available_types,
       ['fact', 'insight', 'procedure', 'concept'] as needed_types,
       total_memories
ORDER BY total_memories DESC

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Graph Query Issues

**Problem**: Queries are slow or timeout
```cypher
-- Solution: Add appropriate indexes
CREATE INDEX ON :Memory(type);
CREATE INDEX ON :Memory(created_at);

-- Use EXPLAIN to analyze query performance
EXPLAIN MATCH (m:Memory)-[r]->(related) RETURN m, r, related;
```

**Problem**: Memory usage is high during complex queries
```cypher
-- Solution: Use LIMIT and pagination
MATCH (m:Memory)-[r*1..3]-(related)
RETURN m, related
ORDER BY m.created_at DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Problem**: Relationship queries return unexpected results
```cypher
-- Solution: Be explicit about relationship direction
MATCH (m:Memory)-[:BUILDS_ON]->(target)  -- Directed
-- vs
MATCH (m:Memory)-[:BUILDS_ON]-(target)   -- Undirected
```
