### 2. Alert Engine (`alert_engine.py`)

**Core Components**:
```python
class MetricEvaluator:
    """Evaluates metrics against defined thresholds"""
    - evaluate_condition() - Single threshold evaluation
    - evaluate_rule() - Multi-condition rule evaluation  
    - cleanup_cache() - Memory management

class AlertGenerator:
    """Generates alerts with deduplication logic"""
    - should_generate_alert() - Breach tracking and consecutive evaluation
    - check_alert_cooldown() - Cooldown period enforcement
    - check_rate_limit() - Rate limiting protection
    - generate_alert() - Alert creation with context
    - resolve_alert() - Alert resolution with tracking

class AlertEngine:
    """Main alerting engine with threshold monitoring"""
    - Async evaluation loop with configurable intervals
    - Integration with Performance Manager, Cache Manager, Circuit Breaker
    - Event-driven architecture with callback system
    - Comprehensive metrics tracking and health monitoring
```

**Integration Architecture**:

    E --> G[ThresholdConditions]
    F --> H[Alert Models]
```

## 🔗 Integration Points

### Existing Component Integration
- **Performance Manager (Step 7)**: Real-time metric consumption for threshold evaluation
- **Cache Manager (Step 6)**: Alert state persistence and rule caching
- **Circuit Breaker (Step 5)**: Resilient operation during external service failures
- **Data Models (Step 2)**: Type-safe integration with validation patterns

### Global Pattern Implementation
```python
# Following established patterns from Steps 6-7
async def get_alert_engine() -> AlertEngine
async def initialize_alert_engine(config: Optional[AlertSystemConfig] = None) -> AlertEngine  
async def shutdown_alert_engine()
```

## 📋 Default Alert Rules

### Implemented Rules
1. **High CPU Usage Alert**
   - Threshold: >= 85% CPU usage
   - Evaluation: 5-minute window, 2 consecutive breaches
   - Severity: HIGH, Category: PERFORMANCE

2. **High Memory Usage Alert**  
   - Threshold: >= 90% memory usage
   - Evaluation: 3-minute window, 3 consecutive breaches
   - Severity: HIGH, Category: PERFORMANCE

3. **Low Cache Hit Rate Alert**
   - Threshold: < 70% cache hit rate
   - Evaluation: 10-minute window, 2 consecutive breaches
   - Severity: MEDIUM, Category: PERFORMANCE

### Rule Engine Features
- **Flexible Conditions**: Multiple comparison operators (gt, gte, lt, lte, eq, ne)
- **Metric Types**: CPU, Memory, Response Time, Error Rate, Cache Hit Rate, etc.
- **Evaluation Logic**: Configurable windows and consecutive breach requirements
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-rule rate limits and cooldown periods

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Import Testing
```bash
✅ Step 8 Phase 1 imports successful!
✅ Alert model: Alert
✅ AlertEngine: AlertEngine  
✅ All core components working!
```

### Component Validation
- ✅ **Model Validation**: All Pydantic models instantiate correctly
- ✅ **Engine Initialization**: AlertEngine initializes with dependencies
