## 🔧 **Technical Solutions Implemented**

### **Gateway Worker Management**
```python
# Fixed test setup to include proper worker initialization
await analytics_gateway.start(num_workers=1)
```

### **Circuit Breaker Exception Handling**
```python
except HTTPException:
    # Let HTTPException propagate (e.g., circuit breaker, service unavailable)
    raise
except Exception as e:
    # Handle other exceptions as error responses
    return GatewayResponse(...)
```

### **Timeout Protection**
```python
# Added test timeouts to prevent hanging
try:
    await asyncio.wait_for(run_test(), timeout=30.0)
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    pytest.fail("Test timed out - indicates blocking operation")
```

### **Service Registry Mock Improvements**
```python
# Fixed service registration method signature
service = await service_registry.register_service(
    service_id="test-analytics",
    service_name="Test Analytics Service",
    service_type=ServiceType.ANALYTICS_ENGINE,
    endpoint_url="http://localhost:8001",
    capabilities=["centrality", "clustering"],
    version="1.0.0"
)
```

## 🎯 **Key Decisions Made**

### **Decision 1: Gateway Worker Architecture**
**Context**: Tests were hanging due to queue-based processing
**Decision**: Implement proper worker lifecycle management in tests
**Rationale**: Enables realistic testing of production queue behavior
**Impact**: Eliminated test hanging, enabled proper integration testing

### **Decision 2: Exception Handling Strategy**
**Context**: Circuit breaker exceptions were being caught and converted
**Decision**: Let HTTPException propagate while handling other exceptions
**Rationale**: Maintains proper error semantics for circuit breaker pattern
**Impact**: Circuit breaker functionality now works correctly

### **Decision 3: Service Registry Mock Strategy**
**Context**: Health checks were causing test failures
**Decision**: Mock health check methods during service registration
**Rationale**: Isolates unit tests from network dependencies
**Impact**: Reliable, fast test execution without external services

### **Decision 4: Type Safety Approach**
**Context**: External libraries causing mypy errors
**Decision**: Use targeted type ignores for external library issues
**Rationale**: Maintains type safety for our code while handling library quirks
**Impact**: 100% mypy compliance achieved
