```python
async def acknowledge_alert(self, alert_id: str, acknowledged_by: str):
    # Update alert state
    self._alert_states[alert_id] = AlertState.ACKNOWLEDGED
    
    # Trigger notification
    await self.notification_dispatcher.dispatch_alert(alert)
    
    # Event callbacks
    await self._trigger_state_change_callbacks(alert_id, AlertState.ACKNOWLEDGED)

    - Average resolution and acknowledgment times
    - Alerts by severity, category, and state
    - Resolution time analytics
    - System health indicators
```
