# Implementation Plan for MCP Server for Flutter/Dart (Smithery Deployment)

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to create, deploy, and maintain an open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server tailored for Flutter/Dart development, hosted on Smithery, with a full range of tools and environment variables for sensitive data. **Cloudflare deployment steps have been removed; Smithery is the sole deployment target.**

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Environment Configuration
1. **Initialize Project Repository**:
   - Create a new GitHub repository under an open-source license (MIT recommended).
   - Initialize a Dart project using `dart create flutter_mcp_server`.
   - Add a `README.md`, `LICENSE` (MIT), and `.gitignore` for Dart/Flutter projects.
2. **Set Up Local Development Environment**:
   - Install Dart SDK (version ≥3.4.4) and Flutter SDK.
   - Install Visual Studio Code with the Dart and Flutter extensions.
   - Install Cloudflare Wrangler CLI (`npm install -g wrangler`) for deployment.
3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env.example` file listing required variables (e.g., `DART_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY`).
   - Use the `dotenv` Dart package to load environment variables securely.
   - Ensure sensitive data (API keys, tokens) are stored in Cloudflare Workers environment variables during deployment.

## Phase 2: MCP Server Development
4. **Integrate MCP Server Package**:
   - Add the `mcp_server` Dart package (`dart pub add mcp_server`) to implement MCP protocol (supports versions 2024-11-05 and 2025-03-26).[](https://pub.dev/packages/mcp_server)
   - Initialize an MCP server with basic capabilities (tools, resources, prompts).
5. **Implement Core Tools**:
   - Develop tools for Dart/Flutter SDK commands:
     - `analyze`: Run `dart analyze` to detect code issues.
     - `format`: Apply `dart format` for code formatting.
     - `fix`: Execute `dart fix` to apply suggested fixes.
     - `create`: Scaffold new Dart/Flutter projects.
     - `run`: Execute Flutter apps in debug mode.
     - `test`: Run `dart test` for unit tests.
   - Implement Flutter-specific tools:
     - `get_diagnostics`: Analyze Dart/Flutter files for errors.[](https://mcp.so/server/flutter-tools)
     - `apply_fixes`: Apply automated fixes to Dart files.
     - `flutter_inspector`: Integrate with Flutter DevTools for widget inspection.
   - Use standardized JSON schemas for tool inputs and outputs.
6. **Add Advanced Features**:
   - Implement caching for resources using `mcp_server`’s built-in caching mechanism to improve performance.
   - Add logging with the `logger` package for debugging and monitoring.
   - Support progress reporting for long-running operations (e.g., project creation).
7. **Integrate with Smithery Registry**:
   - Register the MCP server and tools with Smithery Registry for discoverability by AI agents.[](https://github.com/Arenukvern/mcp_flutter)
   - Ensure compatibility with MCP clients like Windsurf and Cline.[](https://mcpmarket.com/server/dart-1)

## Phase 3: Smithery Deployment
8. **Prepare Smithery Deployment Files**:
   - Ensure a valid `Dockerfile` is present in the repository root, building your Dart MCP server for Linux (see smithery-deployment-doc.md for requirements).
   - Ensure a valid `smithery.yaml` is present in the repository root, specifying the stdio start command and config schema.
9. **Deploy to Smithery**:
   - Go to the Smithery web UI and create or claim your server.
   - Upload or connect your repository with the `Dockerfile` and `smithery.yaml`.
   - Configure environment variables in the Smithery deployment interface.
   - Deploy and verify the MCP server using the built-in MCP playground and registry integration.
10. **Enable Discoverability & Integration**:
    - Register your MCP server and tools with the Smithery Registry for AI agent discoverability.
    - Ensure compatibility with MCP clients like Windsurf and Cline.[](https://mcpmarket.com/server/dart-1)

## Phase 4: Testing and Validation
12. **Unit and Integration Testing**:
    - Write unit tests for each tool using `test` package.
    - Test MCP protocol compatibility with sample clients (e.g., Claude Desktop, Cursor).
    - Validate OAuth integration and environment variable security.
13. **End-to-End Testing**:
    - Use the Smithery MCP playground or compatible MCP client to test end-to-end client-server interactions.
    - Verify tool functionality with a sample Flutter project (e.g., code analysis, formatting).
14. **Performance Testing**:
    - Measure response times for tool executions.
    - Optimize caching and resource handling based on test results.

## Phase 5: Resource & Context Features for LLMs

15. **Implement Resources Capability**:
    - Enable the `resources` capability in the MCP server configuration.
    - Design the resource interface to allow LLMs to query for general Flutter/Dart knowledge, use cases, and best practices.
16. **Expose Knowledge Tools & Endpoints**:
    - Add tools or endpoints that provide:
      - Latest Flutter/Dart news or changelogs.
      - Official documentation links and summaries.
      - Common use cases, patterns, and sample code.
    - Integrate with sources such as dart.dev, flutter.dev, pub.dev, and community-curated lists.
17. **Add Search Tool for Docs/Community Resources**:
    - Implement a tool that accepts a natural language query and returns relevant Flutter/Dart documentation, articles, or code examples.
    - Optionally, aggregate results from multiple sources (official docs, pub.dev, community blogs).

## Phase 6: Open-Source Community Engagement
18. **Document the Project**:
    - Create detailed documentation in `README.md` and a `docs/` folder.
    - Include setup instructions, tool descriptions, and Smithery deployment guide.
    - Provide examples for integrating with AI clients.
19. **Publish to Pub.dev**:
    - Package the MCP server as a Dart package and publish to `pub.dev`.
    - Ensure version compatibility with MCP protocol specs.
20. **Encourage Contributions**:
    - Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file with guidelines for issues and pull requests.
    - Promote the project on X, Reddit (r/mcp), and Flutter/Dart communities.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/mcp/comments/1ilmaur/flutter_tools_mcp_server_enables_interaction_with/)
    - Respond to issues and merge pull requests promptly.

## Phase 7: Maintenance and Iteration
21. **Monitor and Update**:
    - Use Smithery logs and analytics to monitor server usage and performance.
    - Update the server for new MCP protocol versions or Flutter SDK changes.
22. **Add New Tools**:
    - Based on community feedback, implement additional tools (e.g., Flutter hot reload integration).
    - Explore integrations with other AI platforms (e.g., DeepSeek via BytePlus ModelArk).[](https://www.byteplus.com/en/topic/541549)
23. **Security Audits**:
    - Regularly audit OAuth and environment variable handling for vulnerabilities.
    - Address security concerns raised by the community (e.g., unauthorized access risks).[](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/mcp)
