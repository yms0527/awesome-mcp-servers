Cursor is a world-class AI-powered code editor built for programming with AI. It supports MCP servers, and by adding Endgame, you'll enable Cursor to seamlessly deploy any code that it writes.

## Install Cursor

If you don't already have Cursor installed, download it from the [official Cursor website](https://cursor.sh/) and follow their installation guide.

## Add Endgame MCP Server

### Quick Install (Recommended)

Click this button to install the Endgame MCP server into Cursor with one click:

<a href="cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=Endgame&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IiwiYXJncyI6WyJlbmRnYW1lLW1jcEBsYXRlc3QiXSwiZW52Ijp7IkFQSV9LRVkiOiIifX0=" class="unstyled-link" style="text-decoration: none !important; border: none !important; outline: none !important; color: inherit !important;"><img src="https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-light.svg" alt="Add Endgame MCP server to Cursor" height="32" /></a>

After installation, you'll need to add your API key to the environment variable. You can get your API key from Endgame's [dashboard](https://dashboard.endgame.dev).

### Manual Installation

Alternatively, you can manually add the Endgame MCP server to Cursor by following these steps:

1. Open Cursor
2. Go to **Cursor Settings**
3. Navigate to **MCP** section
4. Click **Add new MCP Server**
5. Enter the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "endgame": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["endgame-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "your_endgame_api_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `your_endgame_api_key` with your actual Endgame API key, which you can obtain from Endgame's [dashboard](https://dashboard.endgame.dev).

## Verify Installation

To confirm the MCP server has been correctly installed, you can check the MCP status within Cursor or look for the Endgame tools in the Cursor interface.

Once configured, you can use the Endgame tools directly within Cursor conversations to manage your applications and deployments seamlessly.
