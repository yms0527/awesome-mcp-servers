and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.0]

🚀 **FastAPI-MCP now supports Streamable HTTP transport.**

HTTP transport is now the recommended approach, following the specification that positions HTTP as the standard while maintaining SSE for backwards compatibility.

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
- **`mount()` method is deprecated** and will be removed in a future version. Use `mount_http()` for HTTP transport (recommended) or `mount_sse()` for SSE transport.

### Added
- 🎉 **Streamable HTTP Transport Support** - New `mount_http()` method implementing the MCP Streamable HTTP specification
- 🎉 **Stateful Session Management** - For both HTTP and SSE transports

## [0.3.7]

### Fixed
- 🐛 Fix a bug with OAuth default_scope (#123)

## [0.3.6]

Skipped 0.3.5 due to a broken release attempt.

### Added
- 🚀 Add configurable HTTP header forwarding (#181)

### Fixed
- 🐛 Fix a bug with handling FastAPI `root_path` parameter (#163)

## [0.3.4]

### Fixed
- 🐛 Update the `mcp` dependency to `1.8.1`. Fixes [Issue #134](https://github.com/tadata-org/fastapi_mcp/issues/134) that was caused after a breaking change in mcp sdk 1.8.0.

## [0.3.3]

Fixes the broken release from 0.3.2.

### Fixed
- 🐛 Fix critical bug in openapi conversion (missing `param_desc` definition) (#107, #99)
- 🐛 Fix non-ascii support (#66)

## [0.3.2] - Broken

This is a broken release and should not be used.

### Fixed
- 🐛 Fix a bug preventing simple setup of [basic token passthrough](docs/03_authentication_and_authorization.md#basic-token-passthrough)

## [0.3.1]

🚀 FastApiMCP now supports MCP Authorization!

You can now add MCP-compliant OAuth configuration in a FastAPI-native way, using your existing FastAPI `Depends()` that we all know and love.

### Added
- 🎉 Support for Authentication / Authorization compliant to [MCP 2025-03-26 Specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization), using OAuth 2.1. (#10)
- 🎉 Support passing http headers to tool calls (#82)

## [0.3.0]

🚀 FastApiMCP now works with ASGI-transport by default.

This means the `base_url` argument is redundant, and thus has been removed.

You can still set up an explicit base URL using the `http_client` argument, and injecting your own `httpx.AsyncClient` if necessary.

### Removed
- ⚠️ Breaking Change: Removed `base_url` argument since it's not used anymore by the MCP transport.

### Fixed
- 🐛 Fix short timeout issue (#71), increasing the default timeout to 10


## [0.2.0]

### Changed
- Complete refactor from function-based API to a new class-based API with `FastApiMCP`
- Explicit separation between MCP instance creation and mounting with `mcp = FastApiMCP(app)` followed by `mcp.mount()`
- FastAPI-native approach for transport providing more flexible routing options
- Updated minimum MCP dependency to v1.6.0

### Added
- Support for deploying MCP servers separately from API service
- Support for "refreshing" with `setup_server()` when dynamically adding FastAPI routes. Fixes [Issue #19](https://github.com/tadata-org/fastapi_mcp/issues/19)
- Endpoint filtering capabilities through new parameters:
  - `include_operations`: Expose only specific operations by their operation IDs
  - `exclude_operations`: Expose all operations except those with specified operation IDs
  - `include_tags`: Expose only operations with specific tags
  - `exclude_tags`: Expose all operations except those with specific tags

### Fixed
- FastAPI-native approach for transport. Fixes [Issue #28](https://github.com/tadata-org/fastapi_mcp/issues/28)
- Numerous bugs in OpenAPI schema to tool conversion, addressing [Issue #40](https://github.com/tadata-org/fastapi_mcp/issues/40) and [Issue #45](https://github.com/tadata-org/fastapi_mcp/issues/45)

### Removed
- Function-based API (`add_mcp_server`, `create_mcp_server`, etc.)
- Custom tool support via `@mcp.tool()` decorator

### Fixed
- [Issue #25](https://github.com/tadata-org/fastapi_mcp/issues/25): Dynamically creating tools function so tools are useable.

## [0.1.4]

### Fixed
- [Issue #8](https://github.com/tadata-org/fastapi_mcp/issues/8): Converted tools unuseable due to wrong passing of arguments.

## [0.1.3]

### Fixed
- Dependency resolution issue with `mcp` package and `pydantic-settings`

## [0.1.2]

### Changed
- Complete refactor: transformed from a code generator to a direct integration library
- Replaced the CLI-based approach with a direct API for adding MCP servers to FastAPI applications
- Integrated MCP servers now mount directly to FastAPI apps at runtime instead of generating separate code
- Simplified the API with a single `add_mcp_server` function for quick integration
- Removed code generation entirely in favor of runtime integration

### Added
- Main `add_mcp_server` function for simple MCP server integration
- Support for adding custom MCP tools alongside API-derived tools
- Improved test suite
- Manage with uv

### Removed
- CLI interface and all associated commands (generate, run, install, etc.)

## [0.1.1] - 2024-07-03

### Fixed
