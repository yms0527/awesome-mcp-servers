# Feature: Enhanced Backend Logging for /api/memory-files

**Status:** Completed

**Description:** Implement specific logging for requests targeting the removed `/api/memory-files` endpoint to identify stale clients, without restoring the endpoint or altering the 404 response. This corresponds to Step 1 in `docs/bugs/fix_memory_files_404.md`.

**Tasks:**

1.  [x] **Create Task List:** Define the steps for implementing the enhanced logging.
2.  [x] **Analyze Implementation Options:** Evaluate using FastAPI Middleware vs. a custom Exception Handler.
3.  [x] **Propose Solutions & Get Approval:** Present options, rationale, and confidence score to the user and get approval for the chosen approach. (Option 1: Middleware approved)
4.  [x] **Read Existing Code:** Examine `backend/app/main.py` to understand current middleware, exception handlers, and logging setup.
5.  [x] **Implement Logging Logic:** Add the chosen mechanism (Middleware) to log request details for `/api/memory-files`.
    *   [x] Log path, query params, method, User-Agent, Referer, Client IP, Timestamp.
    *   [x] Ensure the log message is clear and structured.
    *   [x] Ensure the standard 404 response is still returned after logging.
6.  [x] **Verify Implementation:** Review the code changes to confirm they meet all requirements and constraints.
7.  [ ] **Seal Task:** Mark the task as complete upon user confirmation.
