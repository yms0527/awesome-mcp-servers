# BUG: "Pages Crawled" Counter Shows 0 Incorrectly

**Issue:** The "Pages Crawled" counter in the "Data" statistics section (likely rendered by `components/JobStatsSummary.tsx`) displays 0, even when multiple URLs in the Crawl Queue have reached the 'completed' status.

**Observed Behavior:** (See user-provided images)
*   Crawl Queue shows URLs with status 'completed'.
*   "Data" tab shows "Pages Crawled: 0".

**Expected Behavior:** The "Pages Crawled" counter should accurately reflect the number of URLs within the current `jobStatus.urls` object that have `status: 'completed'`.

**Affected Components:**
*   `components/JobStatsSummary.tsx` (Likely responsible for calculating/displaying the stat)
*   `app/page.tsx` (Provides `jobStatus` prop to `JobStatsSummary`)
*   `lib/types.ts` (Definition of `CrawlJobStatus` and `UrlStatus`)

**Potential Causes:**
*   Logic within `JobStatsSummary.tsx` incorrectly calculates the count of completed pages from the `jobStatus.urls` object.
*   The `jobStatus` prop being passed from `app/page.tsx` to `JobStatsSummary.tsx` might be stale or incomplete at the time of rendering the count.
*   Misinterpretation of the `UrlStatus` enum/type ('completed').

**Analysis (Code Mode):**
*   Prop passing from `app/page.tsx` was correct.
*   The calculation logic in `countUrlsByStatus` within `components/JobStatsSummary.tsx` was incorrect; it wasn't properly accessing the `status` within the `UrlDetails` object for each URL.
