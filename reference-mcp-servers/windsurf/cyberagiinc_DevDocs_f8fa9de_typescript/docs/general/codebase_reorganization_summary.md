# Codebase Reorganization Summary

## Overview

The codebase has been reorganized to improve its structure and maintainability. This document summarizes the changes made and how to work with the new structure.

## New Directory Structure

The codebase now follows a more organized structure:

```
Project Root/
├── scripts/             # Shell scripts and other executable files
│   ├── general/         # General utility scripts
│   ├── test/            # Test-related scripts
│   ├── docker/          # Docker-related scripts
│   └── mcp/             # MCP-related scripts
├── docs/                # Documentation files
│   ├── general/         # General documentation
│   ├── docker/          # Docker-related documentation
│   └── mcp/             # MCP-related documentation
├── docker/              # Docker-related files
│   ├── dockerfiles/     # Dockerfile definitions
│   └── compose/         # Docker Compose files
├── config/              # Configuration files
├── app/                 # Application source code (unchanged)
├── backend/             # Backend source code (unchanged)
├── components/          # Frontend components (unchanged)
└── [other directories]  # Other existing directories (unchanged)
```

## Files Moved

### Documentation Files
- `DOCKER_README.md` → `docs/docker/`
- `docker-strategy.md` → `docs/docker/`
- `docker_implementation_plan.md` → `docs/docker/`
- `MCP_DOCKER_SETUP.md` → `docs/mcp/`
- `docker_mcp_integration_plan.md` → `docs/mcp/`
- `in_memory_files_plan.md` → `docs/general/`

### Docker Files
- `Dockerfile.backend` → `docker/dockerfiles/`
- `Dockerfile.frontend` → `docker/dockerfiles/`
- `Dockerfile.mcp` → `docker/dockerfiles/`
- `docker-compose.yml` → `docker/compose/`

### Script Files
- `check_crawl4ai.sh` → `scripts/general/`
- `debug_crawl4ai.sh` → `scripts/general/`
- `start.sh`, `start.bat`, `start.ps1` → `scripts/general/`
- `view_result.sh` → `scripts/general/`
- `docker-start.sh`, `docker-start.bat` → `scripts/docker/`
- `check_mcp_health.sh` → `scripts/mcp/`
- `restart_and_test_mcp.sh` → `scripts/mcp/`
- `test_crawl4ai.py`, `test_from_container.sh` → `scripts/test/`

### Configuration Files
- `components.json` → `config/`
- `tailwind.config.ts` → `config/`
- `postcss.config.mjs` → `config/`
- `next.config.mjs` → `config/`
- `tsconfig.json` → `config/`
- `claude_mcp_settings.json` → `config/`

## Backward Compatibility

To maintain backward compatibility, symbolic links have been created in the root directory for all moved files. This ensures that existing scripts and commands that reference the original file locations will continue to work.

For example, running `./docker-start.sh` in the root directory will still work, even though the actual file is now located at `scripts/docker/docker-start.sh`.

## Docker Configuration Updates

The `docker-compose.yml` file has been updated to reference the new Dockerfile locations:

```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: docker/dockerfiles/Dockerfile.frontend
    # ...

  backend:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: docker/dockerfiles/Dockerfile.backend
    # ...

  mcp:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: docker/dockerfiles/Dockerfile.mcp
    # ...
```

## Verification

A verification script has been created at `scripts/test/verify_reorganization.sh` to ensure that the reorganization was successful. This script checks:

1. All symbolic links are working correctly
2. The docker-compose.yml file has been updated with the new Dockerfile paths
3. docker-compose can parse the updated docker-compose.yml file

## Working with the New Structure

### Running Scripts

You can continue to run scripts from the root directory as before:

```bash
./docker-start.sh
./start.sh
```

Or you can run them from their new locations:

```bash
./scripts/docker/docker-start.sh
./scripts/general/start.sh
```

### Editing Files

When editing files, it's recommended to use the actual file paths rather than the symbolic links. For example, to edit the docker-compose.yml file:

```bash
# Recommended
vim docker/compose/docker-compose.yml

# Not recommended (but will work)
vim docker-compose.yml
```

### Adding New Files

When adding new files, place them in the appropriate directory based on their purpose:

- Scripts → `scripts/` (with appropriate subdirectory)
- Documentation → `docs/` (with appropriate subdirectory)
- Docker files → `docker/` (with appropriate subdirectory)
- Configuration files → `config/`

## Benefits of the New Structure

1. **Improved Organization**: Files are grouped by purpose and type
2. **Reduced Root Directory Clutter**: Root directory contains only essential files
3. **Better Maintainability**: Easier to find and manage related files
4. **Clearer Project Structure**: New developers can understand the project organization more easily
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between code, configuration, documentation, and scripts
