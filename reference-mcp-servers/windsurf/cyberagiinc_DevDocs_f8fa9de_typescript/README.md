<summary>Note for Windows Users</summary>

> If you encounter permission issues, you may need to run the script as administrator or manually set permissions on the logs, storage, and crawl_results directories. The script uses the `icacls` command to set permissions, which might require elevated privileges on some Windows systems.
>
> **Manually Setting Permissions on Windows**:
>
> If you need to manually set permissions, you can do so using either the Windows GUI or command line:
>
> **Using Windows Explorer**:
> 1. Right-click on each directory (logs, storage, crawl_results)
> 2. Select "Properties"
> 3. Go to the "Security" tab
> 4. Click "Edit" to change permissions
> 5. Click "Add" to add users/groups
> 6. Type "Everyone" and click "Check Names"
> 7. Click "OK"
> 8. Select "Everyone" in the list
> 9. Check "Full control" under "Allow"
> 10. Click "Apply" and "OK"
>
> **Using Command Prompt (as Administrator)**:
> ```cmd
> icacls logs /grant Everyone:F /T
> icacls storage /grant Everyone:F /T
> icacls crawl_results /grant Everyone:F /T
> ```
</details> 

<details>
<summary>Note about docker-compose.yml on Windows</summary>

> If you encounter issues with the docker-compose.yml file (such as "Top-level object must be a mapping" error), the `docker-start.bat` script automatically fixes this by ensuring the file has the correct format and encoding. This fix is applied every time you run the script, so you don't need to manually modify the file.
</details>

```
  </details>
 <br>

4. **Mode-Specific Custom Instructions Prompt**
<details>
<summary> Prompt </summary>


```
1. Table Of Contents Tool: Returns a full or filtered list of documentation topics. 
2. Section Access Tool: Retrieves the detailed content of specific documentation sections.

General Process: Query Interpretation: Parse the user's query to extract key topics, keywords, and context. Identify the likely relevant sections (e.g., API configurations, error handling) from the query.

Discovery via Table Of Contents: Use the Table Of Contents tool to search the documentation index for relevant sections. Filter or scan titles and metadata for matching keywords.

Drill-Down Using Section Access: For each identified relevant document or section, use the Section Access tool to retrieve its content. If multiple parts are needed, request all related sections to ensure comprehensive coverage.

Synthesis and Response Formation: Combine the retrieved content into a coherent and complete answer. Reference section identifiers or document paths for traceability. Validate that every aspect of the query has been addressed.

Error Handling: If no matching sections are found, adjust the search parameters and retry. Clearly report if the query remains ambiguous or if no relevant documentation is available.

Mandatory Tool Usage: 
Enforcement: Every time a query is received that requires information from the MCP server docs, the agent MUST first query the Table Of Contents tool to list potential relevant topics, then use the Section Access tool to retrieve the necessary detailed content.

Search & Retrieve Workflow: 
Interpret and Isolate: Identify the key terms and data points from the user's query.

Index Lookup: Immediately query the Table Of Contents tool to obtain a list of relevant documentation sections.

Targeted Retrieval: For each promising section, use the Section Access tool to get complete content.

Information Synthesis: Merge the retrieved content, ensuring all necessary details are included and clearly referenced.

Fallback and Clarification: If initial searches yield insufficient data, adjust the query parameters and retrieve additional sections as needed.

Custom Instruction Loading: Additional custom instructions specific to Research_MCP mode may be loaded from the .clinerules-research-mcp file in your workspace. These may include further refinements or constraints based on evolving documentation structures or query types.

Final Output Construction: The final answer should be organized, directly address the query, and include clear pointers (e.g., section names or identifiers) back to the MCP documentation. Ensure minimal redundancy while covering all necessary details.

⸻

### 1. Enhanced Crawler Logic for Dynamic Content

- Implement `wait_for_images=True` to ensure all images are fully loaded before extraction.
- Set `scan_full_page=True` to force the crawler to scroll through the entire page, triggering lazy-loaded content.
- Introduce `scroll_delay` to add delays between scroll steps, allowing content to load properly.
- Incorporate `wait_for` parameters to wait for specific DOM elements indicative of content loading completion.

---

### 2. Hot Loading with Browser Pooling

- Implement a pool of pre-warmed browser instances to avoid the overhead of launching a new browser for each task.
- Utilize `use_persistent_context=True` to maintain session data across tasks, reducing the need for repeated logins and setups.

---

### 3. Revamped Docker Containers with Latest DevDocs Integration

- Update Docker images to incorporate the latest DevDocs features and optimizations.
- Include environment variables for API tokens (`CRAWL4AI_API_TOKEN`) to secure API endpoints.
- Set appropriate memory limits and resource constraints to optimize performance.

---

### 4. Multi-OS Docker Instance Support

- Create Docker images for different architectures (e.g., `x86_64`, `ARM`) to support a wide range of systems.
- Implement CI/CD pipelines to build and test images across multiple OS environments, ensuring compatibility and stability.

---

### 5. Memory-Adaptive Crawling

- Integrate DevDocs’ `MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher` to dynamically adjust concurrency based on system memory availability.
- Implement built-in rate limiting to prevent overwhelming target websites and avoid out-of-memory errors.

---

### 6. PDF Upload and Extraction in UI

- Utilize DevDocs’ capability to export pages as PDFs (`pdf=True`) and extract content from them.
- Develop frontend components to handle PDF uploads, display extracted content, and allow users to interact with the data.

---

### 7. Hosted Environment with Persistent Storage and Enhanced UX

- Implement BYO-databases solutions to store data privately, crawl results, and configurations across sessions.
- Design intuitive dashboards and interfaces for users to manage their crawls, view results, and configure settings.
- Ensure responsive design and accessibility across various browsers.
