 * Filter test cases by line ranges (inclusive)

 * Overlap logic:
 * - Test case overlaps if: testStart <= rangeEnd AND testEnd >= rangeStart
 *
 * Examples:
 * - Range 277-283, Test 280-290 → Included (overlaps)
 * - Range 277-283, Test 270-278 → Included (overlaps)
 * - Range 277-283, Test 284-290 → Excluded (no overlap)
 *
 * @param testCases - Test cases with line number metadata
 * @param ranges - Array of line ranges to filter by
 * @returns Filtered test cases that overlap with any range
