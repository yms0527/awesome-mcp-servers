# Development

## Overview

This repository (**public**) provides:
- The core MCP server implementation (published as an NPM package)
- The stdio entry point (CLI)
- The Apify Actor standby HTTP server used for local development/testing

The hosted server (**[mcp.apify.com](https://mcp.apify.com)**) is implemented in an internal Apify repository that depends on this package.

For general information about the Apify MCP Server, features, tools, and client setup, see the [README.md](./README.md).

Key entry points:

- `src/index.ts` - Main library export (`ActorsMcpServer` class)
- `src/index_internals.ts` - Internal exports for testing / advanced usage
- `src/stdio.ts` - Standard input/output (CLI) entry point
- `src/main.ts` - Actor entry point (standby server / debugging)
- `src/input.ts` - Input processing and validation

## Node.js version policy

The minimum supported Node.js version is **18** (`engines.node >= 18` in `package.json`).

**Why Node.js 18 (not higher):**
The MCP server is installed by end-users via `npx` and must work on the widest reasonable range of Node.js versions. Our key dependency, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, requires Node.js >= 18, and our own source code uses no APIs beyond what Node.js 18 provides. Sentry telemetry showed ~20K crash events from users on older Node versions (`File is not defined`, `ReadableStream is not defined`), confirming that many users run older runtimes.

**Rules for maintaining compatibility:**
- Do not use Node.js APIs introduced after v18 (e.g., `import.meta.resolve`, `Array.fromAsync`, `Set.union()`).
- Do not add dependencies that require Node.js > 18 at runtime. Check `engines` field of new dependencies before adding them.
- CI runs unit tests against Node.js 18, 20, 22, and 24 to catch compatibility regressions.
- The `.nvmrc` file pins the latest Node.js version for development tooling (lint, type-check, build) — this is intentionally higher than the minimum supported version.

## How to contribute

Refer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

### Installation

First, install all the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
cd src/web
npm install
```

### Working on the MCP Apps (ChatGPT Apps) UI widgets

The MCP server uses UI widgets from the `src/web/` directory.

See the [OpenAI Apps SDK documentation](https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk) for background on MCP Apps and widgets.

### Production build

If you need the compiled assets copied into the top-level `dist/web` for packaging or integration tests, build everything:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command builds the core project and the `src/web/` widgets, then copies the widgets into the `dist/` directory.

All widget code lives in the self-contained `src/web/` React project. The widgets (MCP Apps) are rendered based on the structured output returned by MCP tools. If you need to add specific data to a widget, modify the corresponding MCP tool's output, since widgets can only render data returned by the MCP tool call result.

> **Important (UI mode):** Widget rendering is enabled only when the server runs in UI mode. Use the `ui=true` query parameter (e.g., `/mcp?ui=true`) or set `UI_MODE=true`.

### Hot-reload development

Run the orchestrator, which starts the web widgets builder in watch mode and the MCP server in standby mode:

```bash
APIFY_TOKEN='your-apify-token' npm run dev
```

What happens:
- The `src/web` project runs `npm run dev` and continuously writes compiled files to `src/web/dist`.
- The MCP server reads widget assets directly from `src/web/dist` (compiled JS/HTML only; no TypeScript or JSX at runtime).
- Editing files under `src/web/src/widgets/*.tsx` triggers a rebuild; the next widget render will use the updated code without restarting the server.

Notes:
- You can get your `APIFY_TOKEN` from [Apify Console](https://console.apify.com/settings/integrations)
- Widget discovery happens when the server connects. Changing widget code is hot-reloaded; adding brand-new widget filenames typically requires reconnecting the MCP client (or restarting the server) to expose the new resource.
- You can preview widgets quickly via the local esbuild dev server at `http://localhost:3226/index.html`.

The MCP server listens on port `3001`. The HTTP server implementation used here is the standby Actor server in `src/actor/server.ts` (used by `src/main.ts` in STANDBY mode). The hosted production server behind [mcp.apify.com](https://mcp.apify.com) is located in the internal Apify repository.

### Using MCP servers with Claude Code

This repository includes a `.mcp.json` configuration file that allows you to use external MCP servers (like the Storybook MCP server) directly within Claude Code for enhanced development workflows.

To use the Storybook MCP server (or any other MCP server that requires authentication), you need to configure your Apify API token in Claude Code's settings:

1. Get your Apify API token from [Apify Console](https://console.apify.com/settings/integrations)
2. Create or edit `.claude/settings.local.json` file
3. Add the following environment variable configuration:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "APIFY_TOKEN": "<YOUR_APIFY_API_TOKEN>"
  }
}
```

4. Restart Claude Code for the changes to take effect

The `.mcp.json` file uses environment variable expansion (`${APIFY_TOKEN}`) to securely reference your token without hardcoding it in the configuration file. This allows you to share the configuration with your team while keeping credentials private.

### Manual testing as an MCP client

To test the MCP server, a human must first configure the MCP server. Once configured, the server exposes tools that become available to the coding agent.

#### 1. Human setup (required before testing)

1. **Configure the MCP server** in your environment (e.g., Claude Code, VS Code, Cursor)
2. **Verify connection**: The client should connect and list available tools automatically
3. **Tools are now available**: Once connected, all MCP tools are exposed and ready to use

#### 2. Coding agent MCP server testing

**Note**: Only execute the tests when explicitly requested by the user.

Once the MCP server is configured, test the MCP tools by:

1. **Invoke each tool** through the MCP client (e.g., ask the AI agent to "search for Actors" or "fetch Actor details for apify/rag-web-browser")
2. **Test with valid inputs** (happy path) — verify outputs match expected formats
3. **Test with invalid inputs** (edge cases) — verify error messages are clear and helpful
4. **Verify key behaviors**:
   - All tools return helpful error messages with suggestions
   - **get-actor-output** supports field filtering using dot notation
   - Search tools support pagination with `limit` and `offset`

**Tools to test:**
- **search-actors** — Search Apify Store (test: valid keywords, empty keywords, non-existent platforms)
- **fetch-actor-details** — Get Actor info (test: valid Actor, non-existent Actor)
- **call-actor** — Execute an Actor with input
- **get-actor-output** — Retrieve Actor results (test: valid datasetId, field filtering, non-existent dataset)
- **search-apify-docs** — Search documentation (test: relevant terms, non-existent topics)
- **fetch-apify-docs** — Fetch a doc page (test: valid URL, non-existent page)

### Testing with MCPJam (optional)

You can use [MCPJam](https://www.mcpjam.com/) to connect to and test the MCP server - run it using `npx @mcpjam/inspector@latest`.

#### Setting up the connection

1. Click **"Add new server"**
2. Fill in a name for the server
3. Enter the URL: `http://localhost:3001/mcp?ui=true` (Note: the `ui=openai` query parameter is required for widget rendering)
4. Select **"No authentication"** as the auth method
5. Click **Add**

#### Testing tools manually

To test how widgets are rendered per tool call:

1. Navigate to the **"App Builder"** section in the left sidebar
2. Select a tool
3. Fill in the required arguments
4. Execute the tool
5. View the rendered widget (or the raw MCP tool result if the tool doesn't return a widget)

#### Testing via chat

For a better testing experience with widget rendering:

1. Navigate to the **"Chat"** section in the left sidebar
2. Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or Anthropic API key, or OpenRouter API key)
3. Chat with the MCP server directly, widgets will be rendered inline

### Testing with ChatGPT (optional)

You can test widget rendering on [chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com) by exposing the local server via ngrok. See the [Apify ChatGPT integration docs](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/chatgpt) for background.

#### Setting up ngrok

The ngrok account credentials are stored in **1Password**. The static domain `mcp-apify.ngrok.dev` has already been created — no setup required.

Add the following to `~/.config/ngrok/ngrok.yml`:

```yaml
tunnels:
  app:
    addr: 3001
    proto: http
    domain: mcp-apify.ngrok.dev
```

Then start the tunnel:

```bash
ngrok start app
```

The MCP server API will be reachable at `https://mcp-apify.ngrok.dev/mcp?ui=true`.

#### Adding the server in ChatGPT

1. Go to [chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com) and open **Settings → Connectors**
2. Click **"Add a custom connector"**
3. Enter the URL: `https://mcp-apify.ngrok.dev/mcp?ui=true`
4. Save and start a new chat

> **Important:** After restarting ngrok, use the **Refresh** button in the connector settings to reconnect — ChatGPT does not detect the tunnel restart automatically.
4. Client receives only MCP-compliant fields such as `content`, `isError`, `structuredContent`, and `_meta`.
