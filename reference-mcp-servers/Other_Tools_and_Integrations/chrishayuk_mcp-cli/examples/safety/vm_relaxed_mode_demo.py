"""AI Virtual Memory: E2E Recall Scenarios

Replicates the three recall patterns observed in live testing:

  Scenario A — Simple facts:     "What is my name?"
  Scenario B — Creative content:  "What rhymes with 'light' in the poem?"
  Scenario C — Tool result data:  "What was the temperature?"

Each scenario verifies that the model uses page_fault (not other tools)
to retrieve evicted conversation content.  Distractor tools (geocode,
web_search) are included alongside VM tools to match the real MCP
environment where 30+ tools compete for the model's attention.

Requires: OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
Usage:   uv run python examples/safety/vm_relaxed_mode_demo.py
