## Features

- View pending tasks
- Filter tasks by project and tags
- Add new tasks with descriptions, due dates, priorities, projects and tags
- Mark tasks as complete

**Note**: This runs your local `task` binary, so TaskWarrior needs to be installed and configured!

> [!WARNING]
> This currently uses task `id` which is an unstable identifier; taskwarrior
> sometimes renumbers tasks when new ones are added or removed. In the future
> this should be more careful, using task UUID instead.
