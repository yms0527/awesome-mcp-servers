## MCP Teams Server Installation Guide

This guide is specifically designed for AI agents like Cline to install and configure the MCP Teams Server for use 
with LLM applications like Claude Desktop, Cursor, Roo Code, and Cline.

### Overview

MCP Teams Server is a communication tool that allows AI assistants to interact with Microsoft Teams Channels.

### Prerequisites

- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/)
- Microsoft Teams account with [proper set-up](./doc/MS-Teams-setup.md)

### Installation and configuration

Add the MCP server configuration to your MCP settings file based on your LLM client.

Remember there is a [pre-built image](https://github.com/InditexTech/mcp-teams-server/pkgs/container/mcp-teams-server) hosted in ghcr.io.
You can install this image by running the following command

```commandline
docker pull ghcr.io/inditextech/mcp-teams-server:latest
```

Sample docker setup:

```yaml
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "msteams": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "TEAMS_APP_ID",
        "-e",
        "TEAMS_APP_PASSWORD",
        "-e",
        "TEAMS_APP_TYPE",
        "-e",
        "TEAMS_APP_TENANT_ID",
        "-e",
        "TEAM_ID",
        "-e",
        "TEAMS_CHANNEL_ID",
        "ghcr.io/inditextech/mcp-teams-server"
      ],
      "env": {

        "TEAM_ID=<fill_me_with_proper_uuid>",
        "TEAMS_CHANNEL_ID=<fill_me_with_proper_uuid>",
        "docker",
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "ghcr.io/inditextech/mcp-teams-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "DOCKER_HOST": "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
      },
      "disabled": false,
