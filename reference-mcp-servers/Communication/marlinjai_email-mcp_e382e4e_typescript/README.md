# @marlinjai/email-mcp

A unified MCP server for email access across Gmail, Outlook, iCloud, and generic IMAP providers.

## Features

- **Multi-provider support** -- Gmail (REST API), Outlook (Microsoft Graph), iCloud (IMAP), and generic IMAP/SMTP
- **OAuth2 authentication** -- Browser-based OAuth flows for Gmail and Outlook, with automatic token refresh
- **Full email client** -- Search, read, send, reply, forward, organize, and manage drafts
- **Batch operations** -- Delete, move, or mark hundreds of emails in a single call
- **Lightweight search** -- Compact search results by default (~20KB vs ~1.4MB) with optional full body retrieval
- **Encrypted credential storage** -- AES-256-GCM encryption at rest with machine-derived keys
- **Provider-native APIs** -- Uses Gmail API and Microsoft Graph where available for richer features, falls back to IMAP for universal compatibility

## Installation

Install globally from npm:

```bash
npm install -g @marlinjai/email-mcp
```

Or run directly with npx (no install needed):

```bash
npx @marlinjai/email-mcp
```

## Quick Start

1. Run the interactive setup wizard to add your email accounts:

```bash
npx @marlinjai/email-mcp setup
```

The wizard will walk you through provider selection and authentication. After each account, it asks if you'd like to add another — so you can set up Gmail, Outlook, and iCloud all in one go.

2. Add the server to your MCP configuration (`.mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "email": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@marlinjai/email-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Start using email tools in Claude Code — search your inbox, send emails, organize messages, and more.

## Provider Setup Guides

### Gmail

No configuration needed — the setup wizard handles everything using built-in OAuth credentials (PKCE):

```bash
npx @marlinjai/email-mcp setup
# Select "Gmail" when prompted
# A browser window opens for Google authorization
# Grant the requested permissions and return to the terminal
```

> **Note:** If you prefer to use your own OAuth app, create a Desktop OAuth 2.0 Client in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) with the Gmail API enabled.

### Outlook

No configuration needed — the setup wizard handles everything using built-in OAuth credentials (PKCE):

```bash
npx @marlinjai/email-mcp setup
# Select "Outlook" when prompted
# A browser window opens for Microsoft authorization
# Sign in and grant the requested permissions
```

> **Note:** If you prefer to use your own OAuth app, register one in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) with `Mail.ReadWrite`, `Mail.Send`, and `offline_access` permissions.

### iCloud

1. Go to [appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com/) and sign in.
2. Navigate to **App-Specific Passwords** and generate a new password.
3. Run the setup wizard:

```bash
npx @marlinjai/email-mcp setup
# Select "iCloud" when prompted
# Enter your iCloud email address
# Enter the app-specific password you generated
```

### Generic IMAP

Run the setup wizard with your IMAP/SMTP server details:

```bash
npx @marlinjai/email-mcp setup
# Select "Other IMAP" when prompted
# Enter your IMAP host, port, and credentials
# Optionally enter SMTP host and port for sending
```

## Usage with Claude Code

Add the following to your `.mcp.json` file (project-level or global `~/.claude/.mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "email": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@marlinjai/email-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Once configured, you can ask Claude to interact with your email:

- "Check my inbox for unread messages"
- "Search for emails from alice@example.com in the last week"
- "Reply to the latest email from Bob and thank him"
- "Move all newsletters to the Archive folder"
- "Delete all spam emails" (uses batch operations for speed)
- "Draft a follow-up email to the team about the meeting"
