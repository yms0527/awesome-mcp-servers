## Local Development with Inspector

You can use the MCP Inspector to test and debug the server locally.

### Prerequisites

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:line/line-bot-mcp-server.git
cd line-bot-mcp-server
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Run the Inspector

After building the project, you can start the MCP Inspector:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/index.js \
  -e CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN="YOUR_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -e DESTINATION_USER_ID="YOUR_DESTINATION_USER_ID"
```

This will start the MCP Inspector interface where you can interact with the LINE Bot MCP Server tools and test their functionality.
