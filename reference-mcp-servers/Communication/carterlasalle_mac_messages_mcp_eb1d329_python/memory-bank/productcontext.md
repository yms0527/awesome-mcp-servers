# Product Context

## Problem Statement

### The Gap
AI assistants like Claude Desktop and Cursor are powerful for code and text work, but they exist in isolation from users' communication workflows. Users frequently need to:
- Reference message conversations while working
- Send updates or questions to colleagues/friends
- Search through message history for context
- Coordinate work through existing communication channels

### Current Pain Points - ALL RESOLVED ✅
1. **Context Switching**: ✅ SOLVED - AI assistants now have direct Messages access
2. **No Message History Access**: ✅ SOLVED - AI can search and reference all conversations
3. **Manual Contact Lookup**: ✅ SOLVED - Fuzzy contact matching works perfectly
4. **Workflow Fragmentation**: ✅ SOLVED - Communication and AI assistance are integrated

## Solution Vision

### Core Experience - FULLY ACHIEVED ✅
Enable AI assistants to become natural extensions of users' communication workflows by providing seamless access to the Messages app. Users can now:

```
User: "Check my recent messages from Sarah and send her an update on the project"
AI: [Searches messages] "Sarah messaged 2 hours ago asking about the timeline. Sending update..." ✅

User: "Search for messages about 'project deadline' from last week"  
AI: [Performs fuzzy search] "Found 3 messages about project deadline from last week..." ✅
