## [Unreleased] - 2025-08-31

### Added
- **Automatic Language Detection**: o3-mini intelligently detects conversation language from call briefs and configures OpenAI transcription accordingly
- **Voice Characteristics Support**: Comprehensive lookup table for all OpenAI voices including gender and personality traits
- **Auto Voice Selection**: New 'auto' mode where o3-mini selects optimal voice based on call context, formality, and goals
- **Structured Output Integration**: Uses OpenAI's JSON schema for reliable, type-safe response parsing from o3-mini
- **Enhanced Token Limits**: Increased max_completion_tokens to 16,000 for comprehensive multilingual instructions
- **Voice Validation**: Robust validation and sanitization for voice names with fallback handling

### Fixed
- **Deterministic Call Termination**: Replaced arbitrary safety timeouts with progress-based audio completion monitoring
- **Missing Transcript Recovery**: Fixed race conditions where final AI messages weren't logged (especially in voicemail scenarios)
- **False Stall Warnings**: Eliminated misleading warnings for near-complete responses (99%+ complete now finish cleanly)
- **Interrupted Response Handling**: Properly track and handle responses interrupted by user barge-in without false warnings
- **Call Hanging Issues**: Resolved cases where calls wouldn't end properly, requiring manual termination

### Improved
- **Audio Completion Monitoring**: Real-time progress tracking (250ms intervals) instead of fixed timeouts
- **Call Reliability**: More robust call termination flow with better edge case handling  
- **Transcript Accuracy**: Enhanced playback-aware transcript logging ensures all AI responses are captured
- **WAV Recording Precision**: Accurate real-time stereo recording reflecting actual call audio timeline
- **Audio Processing Performance**: Optimized streaming latency for improved OpenAI voice recognition
- **Logging Quality**: Cleaner logs with warnings only for genuine issues, not normal operational conditions
- **Multilingual Support**: Instructions and prompts now properly localized based on detected language

### Technical Enhancements
- **Progress-based Monitoring**: Track packet sending progress with stall detection (4s threshold)
- **Near-complete Detection**: Treat ≤2 packets remaining as successful completion
- **Interruption Tracking**: Mark interrupted responses to prevent false monitoring alerts  
- **Playback Position APIs**: Added methods to query current response playback status
- **Enhanced Meta-prompts**: Updated with OpenAI Realtime API best practices and goal optimization
- **Model Compatibility**: Full compatibility with latest `gpt-realtime` model (released August 28, 2025)
- **Voice Metadata**: Voice selection now includes gender and description context for better prompt generation

## [1.2.0] - 2025-09-19

### Added
- **Bundled G.722 WebAssembly Codec**: Ship a precompiled WASM build so `npx` users get wideband audio without native toolchains
- **WASM Build & Postinstall Scripts**: New `npm run build:wasm`, `build:all`, and postinstall safeguards that cache emcc output and skip rebuilds when artifacts already exist
- **Native/WASM Loader Fallback**: Unified loader automatically prefers the native addon when present and transparently falls back to the bundled WASM module

### Changed
- **Default Build Flow**: `npm run build` now refreshes WASM + TypeScript only, leaving native compilation as an opt-in step
- **Distribution Layout**: `dist/` is tracked so prebuilt codecs ship with the package and GitHub `npx` installs work offline
- **Documentation Updates**: README and quick-start instructions highlight the compiler-free WASM codec and new build scripts

## [1.1.0] - 2025-08-28

### Added
- **MCP Server Integration**: Claude Desktop integration for voice calls directly from the chat interface
- **Language Specification**: Enhanced instruction generation with automatic language detection and localization
- **Voice Agent Naturalness**: Improved conversation flow with better number pronunciation and natural speech patterns
- **Call Status Timestamping**: Preserved timestamps in MCP transcript for accurate call timeline tracking

### Enhanced  
- **OpenAI Realtime Model**: Updated to use latest `gpt-realtime` model for improved voice quality and responsiveness
- **Instruction Generation**: Enhanced meta-prompt system with goal optimization and best practice integration

## [1.0.0] - 2025-08-18
