# Communication Style Guide

Use this guide for release notes, issue replies, and changelog entries.

## Rules

1. Keep text technical, concise, and factual.
2. Do not include model/tool credit lines.
3. Do not include co-author trailers from tooling.
4. State exact versions and commands when relevant.
5. Avoid speculative claims.
6. Release titles use `vX.Y.Z — <concrete operational outcome>`.
7. Public artifacts are maintainer-reviewed and maintainer-authored.
8. GitHub is for self-host bugs, docs fixes, and releases; managed support belongs on hosted surfaces.
9. If a PR needs AI review, add the `manual-ai-review` label before invoking the bot explicitly.

## Public Authorship Policy

- AI tooling may assist locally with drafting, checks, and implementation.
- Public releases, issue replies, discussions, and changelog entries ship only after maintainer review.
- Do not include tool attribution, generated-with lines, or bot-style self-reference in public copy.

## Issue Reply Template

```md
Thanks for reporting this.

Status: fixed in `<version>`.

Included:
- `<fix 1>`
- `<fix 2>`

Verify:
- `npx -y @jtalk22/slack-mcp --version`
- `npx -y @jtalk22/slack-mcp --status`

Install/update:
- `npx -y @jtalk22/slack-mcp`
- `npm i -g @jtalk22/slack-mcp@<version>`

If it still reproduces, reply with OS, Node version, runtime mode (`stdio|web|http|worker`), and exact error output.
```
