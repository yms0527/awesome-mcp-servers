and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.2.4] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Release integrity** — Runtime version emitters now resolve from `package.json`, restoring parity for CLI output, Docker smoke tests, and hosted runtime metadata.
- **Public surface drift** — Current README, marketing pages, setup docs, and Cloud plan claims were aligned so self-hosted and managed offerings no longer contradict each other.

### Added
- **Public surface integrity gate** — CI and release preflight now validate current-version surfaces, managed Cloud tool-count claims, and core metadata parity before release.
- **Attribution guardrail regression check** — CI and release preflight now verify the Dependabot skip conditions and main-branch owner enforcement remain intact.
- **Current release docs** — Added a `v3.2.4` release-note block and a same-day release runbook covering the Docker tag push vs GitHub Release sequencing.
- **Support routing visibility** — Deployment intake and support-boundary guidance are now elevated across the current repo trust surfaces.

## [3.2.1] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- **Safety annotations** — `destructiveHint: true` on 4 write-path tools (send_message, add_reaction, remove_reaction, conversations_mark). Claude now prompts for confirmation before write operations.

### Changed
- **README restructured** — 571 → ~180 lines. Annotation table, collapsible install configs, modern MCP patterns. Architecture and internals moved to docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.
- **SECURITY.md updated** — Version table current (3.x), professional language throughout.
- **Setup wizard tagline** — Removed "bypasses OAuth" phrasing.
- **Disclaimer reframed** — Professional language replacing "unofficial APIs."

## [3.2.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **`slack_add_reaction`** — Add emoji reactions to messages
- **`slack_remove_reaction`** — Remove emoji reactions from messages
- **`slack_conversations_mark`** — Mark a conversation as read up to a timestamp
- **`slack_conversations_unreads`** — Priority-sorted unread inbox across all channels and DMs
- **`slack_users_search`** — Search workspace users by name, display name, or email
- REST endpoints: `POST /reactions`, `DELETE /reactions`, `POST /conversations/:id/mark`, `GET /conversations/unreads`, `GET /users/search`

### Fixed
- **server-http.js tool parity** — Hosted HTTP transport now dispatches all 16 tools (was missing reactions, mark, unreads, search)
- **Background timer crash** — `setInterval` callback in server.js wrapped in try/catch to prevent unhandled rejection
- **Express route ordering** — `/users/search` registered before `/users/:id` to prevent "search" matching as user ID

### Changed
- Tool count: 11 → 16 across all three transports (stdio, web, hosted HTTP)
- Cloud docs added to SETUP.md, DEPLOYMENT-MODES.md, and TROUBLESHOOTING.md

### Compatibility
- No MCP tool renames or removals. Fully backwards compatible.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **Cloud product surface** — `cloud.html` landing page with Solo ($19/mo) and Team ($49/mo) Stripe checkout
- **Post-checkout key delivery** — `success.html` polls for provisioned access tokens, shows config with copy-to-clipboard
- **Homepage Cloud CTA** — `index.html` links to Cloud page
- **README Cloud section** — pricing table and Cloud link
- **Revenue Protection** — plan-based tool gating, D1 rate limit persistence, timing-safe admin auth
- **OAuth 2.1 + PKCE S256** — MCP Registry remote endpoint at `mcp.revasserlabs.com/oauth/mcp`
- **MCP Registry v3.1.0 published** with `remotes` section

### Security
- XSS fix: conversation names, user names, and channel names now escaped in web dashboard
- Shell injection fix: Keychain functions use `execFileSync` with array args instead of string interpolation
- Undefined param fix: `null`/`undefined` values no longer sent as literal `"undefined"` to Slack API
- JSON parse guard: non-JSON Slack responses now throw descriptive error instead of crashing
- `formatTimestamp` guards against NaN/undefined input

### Compatibility
- No MCP tool renames or removals. All 11 local tools unchanged.
- Cloud adds 2 AI compound tools (team plan only): `slack_channel_summary`, `slack_extract_action_items`

## [3.0.0] - 2026-02-28

### Changed
- **Hosted `/mcp` now requires auth** — `Authorization: Bearer` header mandatory for HTTP transport
- **CORS allowlisting** — hosted endpoint requires `SLACK_MCP_HTTP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
- Structured auth/CORS error responses for missing token config, invalid bearer, and denied origin
- Publish payload reduced by curating packaged files

### Added
- Web verification checks demo media reachability
- Worker compatibility for tool-facing contracts (`channel_id|channel`, `user_id|user`)

### Breaking (Hosted Only)
- Existing hosted deployments must set `SLACK_MCP_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN` and `SLACK_MCP_HTTP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` before upgrade
- Local `stdio` and `web` paths unchanged — no migration required

### Compatibility
- No MCP tool renames or removals

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed
- Enforced read-only `--status` behavior in install-flow verification for both local and published `npx` paths.
- Added deterministic `--doctor` runtime failure coverage (`exit 3`) using explicit connectivity test wiring.
- Standardized MCP transport tool-call failures with structured error payloads (`status`, `code`, `message`, `next_action`).

### Improved
- Added explicit `unknown_age` token-state semantics when credential timestamps are unavailable.
- Normalized web API error responses to structured diagnostics for auth, validation, and runtime failures.
- Added `verify:version-parity` script and report generation for npm/MCP registry/local metadata parity checks.
- Updated public metadata surface for distribution (`server.json` title, website URL, icon metadata).

### Compatibility
- No MCP tool renames or removals.

## [1.2.4] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed
- Made `--status` deterministic and read-only (no Chrome extraction side effects).
- Standardized `--doctor` behavior with explicit missing/invalid/runtime exit-code coverage in install-flow verification.
- Corrected token-age handling so missing timestamps report unknown age instead of false critical warnings.
- Added explicit Apple Events remediation guidance for Chrome extraction failures.

### Improved
- Unified health/status JSON shape across CLI handlers and web endpoints (`status`, `code`, `message`, `next_action`).
- Kept MCP tool contracts stable while improving runtime diagnostics and operator guidance.

### Compatibility
- No MCP tool renames or removals.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-02-25

### Improved

- Added `--doctor` CLI diagnostics with deterministic exit codes and next-step guidance.

### Compatibility
- No API or MCP tool schema changes.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-02-25

### Improved
- Aligned CLI/setup guidance to `npx -y @jtalk22/slack-mcp` across docs and runtime messaging
- Removed stale token refresh command references
- Added deployment mode, support boundary, and use case recipe docs
- Added demo CTA strip and deployment intake issue template for qualified team rollout requests

### Compatibility
- No API or MCP tool schema changes

## [1.2.1] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed
- Form-encoded params for Slack endpoints that reject JSON (`conversations.replies`, `search.messages`, `search.all`, `search.files`, `users.info`) with server + worker parity
- Default package CLI entrypoint so `npx @jtalk22/slack-mcp` resolves consistently
- Unified CLI dispatch for stdio default plus `web`, `http`, `--setup`, `--status`, `--version`
- Setup wizard now reliably restores environment state after token validation and renders color interpolation correctly

### Security / Runtime
