## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Public NBA CDN asset URLs** included in tool responses for UI clients:
  - Player headshots (1040x760 + 260x190 thumbnails)
  - Team logos (SVG)
- **JSON-first tool responses** across the full server toolset (no legacy text-only responses)
- **Tool completeness checks** in the test suite to ensure no advertised tool returns `Unknown tool`

### Changed
- `get_league_leaders` now uses `leaguedashplayerstats` (PerGame) for current-season leaders

## [0.1.5] - 2025-12-14

### Added
- **Runtime improvements for agent workloads**
  - Non-blocking HTTP execution (no event-loop blocking on network calls)
  - Concurrency limiting, retries with backoff, and TTL caching
  - `get_server_info` tool for diagnostics
  - `resolve_team_id`, `resolve_player_id`, `find_game_id` helper tools for agent ergonomics
- **Better local usage and demos**
  - `python -m nba_mcp_server` support (`__main__.py`)
  - Strands example agent with interactive REPL and `--demo` mode (`examples/strands_nba_agent.py`)
  - Live end-to-end MCP tool smoke test (`scripts/live_mcp_tool_smoke_test.py`)
- **Tooling**
  - Ruff + Bandit configuration in `pyproject.toml`
  - Release tooling (`build`, `twine`) included in dev dependencies

### Changed
- Server now exposes **30 tools**
- Live scoreboard endpoints may return 403 in some environments; server falls back to stats API scoreboard for reliability

### Fixed
- MCP live smoke test no longer “hangs” (proper MCP session lifecycle + better progress output)
- Server startup is more resilient in environments where CA bundles are not readable (`NBA_MCP_TLS_VERIFY`)

### Added
- **Awards Tools**: Two new tools for accessing NBA awards and accolades
  - `get_player_awards` - Get all awards for a specific player (MVP, Championships, All-Star, All-NBA, etc.)
  - `get_season_awards` - Get major award winners for a specific season
- `get_player_game_log` - Get game-by-game statistics showing highest-scoring games
- Comprehensive endpoint verification system
- ENDPOINT_VERIFICATION.md report documenting all working endpoints
- Verification script to test all tools with real API calls
- Test coverage for new awards tools (4 new tests, 29 total)
- Configurable logging via `NBA_MCP_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable (defaults to WARNING for production)

### Fixed
- `get_player_season_stats` now uses `playercareerstats` endpoint (fixes 500 errors)
- `get_league_leaders` now uses `leaguedashplayerstats` endpoint (fixes 500 errors and returns true per-game leaders)

### Changed
- Server now exposes 20 tools (was 18)
- All endpoints verified working and production-ready

## [0.1.0] - 2025-11-03
