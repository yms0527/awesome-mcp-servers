## Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Add to Claude Desktop

Open your Claude Desktop configuration file:
- **Mac**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Add this to the file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "strava": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@r-huijts/strava-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 1 (alternative): Add to Claude Code

You can add this MCP server to claude code with the following command:

```
claude mcp add --transport stdio strava -- npx @r-huijts/strava-mcp-server
```

You can confirm successful instalation as follows:

```
% claude mcp list
Checking MCP server health...

strava: npx @r-huijts/strava-mcp-server - ✓ Connected
```

### Step 2: Restart Claude Desktop

Close and reopen Claude Desktop to load the new configuration.

### Step 3: Connect Your Strava

Just say to Claude:

> **"Connect my Strava account"**

A browser window will open. Enter your Strava API credentials, authorize the app, and you're done!

**That's it!** Start asking about your activities.

---

## Connecting Your Strava Account

### First Time Setup

When you say "Connect my Strava account", here's what happens:

1. **A browser window opens** showing a setup page
2. **Enter your Strava API credentials** (Client ID and Client Secret)
3. **Click "Continue to Strava"** - you'll be redirected to Strava
4. **Authorize the app** on Strava's website
5. **See the success message** - you can close the browser
6. **Done!** Claude confirms you're connected

Your credentials are saved locally at `~/.config/strava-mcp/config.json` and persist across sessions.

### Getting Your Strava API Credentials

You need to create a free Strava API application (one-time setup):

1. Go to [strava.com/settings/api](https://www.strava.com/settings/api)
2. Click "Create an App" (or view your existing app)
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Application Name**: Anything you want (e.g., "My Claude Assistant")
   - **Category**: Choose any
   - **Website**: Can be anything (e.g., `http://localhost`)
   - **Authorization Callback Domain**: Must be `localhost`
4. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

That's it! You only need to do this once.

### Managing Your Connection

- **Check status**: "Am I connected to Strava?"
- **Reconnect**: "Connect my Strava account" (use `force: true` to reconnect)
- **Disconnect**: "Disconnect my Strava account"

## Installation Options

### Option A: Just Use It (Recommended)

No installation needed! The `npx` command in the Quick Start automatically downloads and runs the latest version.

### Option B: Install Globally

If you prefer to install it once:

```bash
npm install -g @r-huijts/strava-mcp-server
```

Then update your Claude config to use:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "strava": {
      "command": "strava-mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** Even though the package name is `@r-huijts/strava-mcp-server`, the executable name remains `strava-mcp-server` for backward compatibility.

### Option C: Build from Source

For developers who want to modify the code:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/r-huijts/strava-mcp.git
   cd strava-mcp
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

Then point Claude to your local build:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "strava": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/strava-mcp/dist/server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Connect my Strava account" doesn't open a browser

- Make sure Claude Desktop is running the MCP server (check for errors in Claude)
- Try restarting Claude Desktop
- Check that port 8111 isn't blocked by a firewall

### "Authentication failed" or "Invalid token"

- Your token may have expired - say "Connect my Strava account" to reconnect
- Make sure your Strava API application is still active at [strava.com/settings/api](https://www.strava.com/settings/api)

### "Missing credentials" error

- You need to complete the OAuth flow - say "Connect my Strava account"
- If you're using environment variables, make sure all 4 are set (see Developer section)

### Claude doesn't see the Strava tools

- Make sure your `claude_desktop_config.json` is valid JSON (no trailing commas!)
- Restart Claude Desktop after making config changes
- Check Claude's developer console for error messages

### JSONRPC.ProtocolTransportError after package name change

If you're getting a JSONRPC error after updating to `@r-huijts/strava-mcp-server`:

1. **Clear npx cache**: Run `rm -rf ~/.npm/_npx` in terminal
2. **Verify config** uses `@r-huijts/strava-mcp-server` (not the old `strava-mcp-server`)
3. **Restart Claude Desktop** completely (quit and reopen)
4. **Test manually**: Run `npx -y @r-huijts/strava-mcp-server` - you should see "Starting Strava MCP Server v1.2.1..."

## For Developers

### Environment Variables

Instead of using the browser-based auth, you can set environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `STRAVA_CLIENT_ID` | Your Strava Application Client ID |
| `STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET` | Your Strava Application Client Secret |
| `STRAVA_ACCESS_TOKEN` | OAuth access token |
| `STRAVA_REFRESH_TOKEN` | OAuth refresh token |
| `ROUTE_EXPORT_PATH` | Directory for GPX/TCX exports |

### Token Refresh

The server automatically refreshes expired tokens. New tokens are saved to both `process.env` and `~/.config/strava-mcp/config.json`.

### Config Priority

1. Environment variables (highest)
2. `~/.config/strava-mcp/config.json`
3. Local `.env` file

### Building & Testing

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

### Activity Streams Optimization

The `get-activity-streams` tool uses a compact format by default, reducing payload size by ~70-80% while preserving all data:

- **Compact format** (default): Raw arrays with metadata, ~70-80% smaller, ideal for LLM processing
- **Verbose format**: Human-readable objects with formatted values (backward compatible)
- **Smart chunking**: Large activities automatically split into ~50KB chunks
- **Optional downsampling**: Can reduce very large datasets while preserving key features

The compact format includes comprehensive metadata (units, descriptions, statistics) so LLMs can understand the raw numeric data.

### API Reference

The server implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and exposes 25 tools for Strava API v3. See the source code in `src/tools/` for implementation details.
