- [x] DOCS-02 - MIT License
- [x] DOCS-03 - Example screenshot
- [x] DOCS-04 - Advanced analytics query examples

### Future (V1)
- [x] TOOL-08 - tp_create_workout (basic: date, sport, title, duration; structured workouts deferred)
- [ ] TOOL-09 - tp_move_workout
- [ ] TOOL-10 - tp_get_health_metrics (sleep, resting HR, HRV, weight)

## Recent Changes (2026-01-09)

### Auth Fix for Claude Desktop
macOS Keychain has app-specific access controls. When Claude Desktop spawns `tp-mcp serve`,
it's a different app context than Terminal where `tp-mcp auth` was run. Keychain silently
blocks access, causing auth failures.

**Fix:** `store_credential()` now writes to both keyring AND encrypted file. The encrypted
file fallback always works regardless of app permissions.

### tp_get_peaks Default Changed to All-Time
Previous default of 365 days caused "best" queries to miss PRs older than 1 year.
Now defaults to 3650 days (~10 years) for true all-time records.

### tp_get_fitness Historical Date Ranges
Added `start_date` and `end_date` parameters (YYYY-MM-DD) for querying historical fitness
data. Enables queries like "CTL/ATL/TSB in the 6 weeks before my Feb 2022 PR".

Previously only supported querying from today backwards using `days` parameter.

## API Endpoint Reference

Verified against live TrainingPeaks API (2026-01-09):

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `/users/v3/token` | Auth validation |
| `/users/v3/user` | User profile (nested: `{ user: { personId } }`) |
| `/fitness/v6/athletes/{id}/workouts/{start}/{end}` | Workout list |
| `/fitness/v6/athletes/{id}/workouts/{workoutId}` | Single workout |
| `/personalrecord/v2/athletes/{id}/workouts/{workoutId}` | PRs per workout |
| `/personalrecord/v2/athletes/{id}/{Sport}?prType=...` | Sport-specific PRs |
| `/fitness/v1/athletes/{id}/reporting/performancedata/{start}/{end}` | CTL/ATL/TSB (POST) |

**Deprecated:** `/fitness/v3/athletes/{id}/powerpeaks` and `/pacepeaks` return 404.

## Architecture Decisions

- Pydantic v2 with ConfigDict for models
- Async validation to avoid nested asyncio.run() on Python 3.14
- 90-day max date range for workouts to prevent context bloat
- 3650-day default for peaks (all-time)
- Dual credential storage (keyring + encrypted file) for cross-app compatibility
- Tool descriptions optimized for LLM efficiency
- Line length 120 for readable tool descriptions
