### Added
- **npm Trusted Publishing**: Implemented OIDC authentication for enhanced security
- **Workflow Security**: Added optional npm-publish environment for additional protection
- **Version Validation**: Automated checks to ensure package version is greater than published version

### Changed
- **CI/CD**: Upgraded npm and improved publishing workflow reliability
- **Authentication**: Removed dependency on NPM_TOKEN secrets in favor of OIDC
- **Publishing**: Enhanced publish step messaging and error handling

### Removed
- **Token Authentication**: Eliminated NPM_TOKEN secret requirement for publishing

### Security

## [1.0.3] - 2025-08-27

### Fixed
- **Exa Research Integration:** Updated to `exa-js@^1.5.13`, switched to default import, and added compatibility with `research.pollTask`. Resolved runtime error `createTask is not a function` for `researchTopic` and `deepResearch` tools.

### Changed
- **VS Code MCP Config Guidance:** Documented how to point VS Code to the local `dist/server.js` for development instead of the globally installed package.

### Added
- **npm Publishing Workflow:** Added automated workflow to publish packages to npm registry

## [1.0.2] - 2025-08-08

### Fixed

- **Server Configuration**: MCP server now reports correct version in protocol metadata

## [1.0.1] - 2025-08-08

### Added
- **CLI Argument Support**: Added `--version` and `--help` command line arguments
- **Graceful Exit**: Server now exits properly for CLI commands instead of hanging

## [1.0.0] - 2025-08-08

### Added
- **Core MCP Tools**: File analysis (`askAboutFile`), terminal execution (`runAndExtract`), follow-up questions (`askFollowUp`)
- **Research Tools**: Quick research (`researchTopic`) and deep research (`deepResearch`) using Exa.ai
- **Multi-LLM Support**: Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, and OpenAI integration
- **Security Layer**: Path validation, command filtering, session management
- **Environment Variable Configuration**: All settings via `CONTEXT_OPT_*` environment variables
