## Testing Execution Process

### Phase 1: Automated Testing

1. Run complete test suite: `make test`
2. Run integration tests: `make integration-test`
3. Verify linting and formatting: `make lint && make fmt`
4. Check Docker build: `make docker`

### Phase 2: Manual Functional Testing

1. Set up test environment with real Panther instance
2. Execute tool-by-tool testing using MCP client
3. Test error scenarios and edge cases
4. Verify new features work as documented
5. Test performance under typical load

### Phase 3: Integration Testing

1. Test with multiple MCP clients
2. Verify transport protocols work correctly
3. Test deployment scenarios (Docker, UVX, direct)
4. Validate documentation examples

### Phase 4: Regression Testing

1. Execute previously failed test cases
2. Verify bug fixes work correctly
3. Ensure no new regressions introduced
4. Test backward compatibility scenarios

## Success Criteria

A release is ready when:

- [ ] All automated tests pass
- [ ] All manual testing checklist items complete
- [ ] Performance meets acceptable thresholds
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Documentation is accurate and complete
- [ ] No critical or high-severity issues remain
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained

## Test Environment Requirements

### Minimum Test Environment

- Python 3.12+
- Valid Panther instance with test data
- API token with comprehensive permissions:
  - Read Alerts, Manage Alerts
  - View Rules, Manage Rules, Manage Policies
  - Query Data Lake, View Log Sources
  - Read User Info, Read Panther Metrics

### Test Data Requirements

- At least 10 alerts in various states
- Multiple detection types (rules, policies, scheduled rules)
- Various log sources and schemas
- User accounts and roles for testing
- Historical data for metrics testing

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues are discovered post-release:

1. Document the issue and impact
2. Determine if hotfix or rollback is appropriate
3. If rolling back:
   - Revert to previous stable version
   - Update documentation
   - Notify users of temporary rollback
   - Plan remediation for next release

## Post-Release Verification

After release:

- [ ] PyPI package installs correctly
- [ ] Docker image pulls and runs successfully
- [ ] Documentation reflects new version
- [ ] Integration examples work with new version
- [ ] Community can successfully use new features

## Notes

- Testing should be performed by someone other than the primary developer when possible
- All test results should be documented with screenshots or logs
- Any failures must be investigated and resolved before release
- Edge cases and error conditions are especially important to test
- Performance regressions should be investigated even if functionality works
