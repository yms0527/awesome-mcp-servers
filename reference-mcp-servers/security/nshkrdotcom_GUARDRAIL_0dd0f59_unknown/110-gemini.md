Okay, this is a fascinating challenge! MCP is currently leveraging JSON-RPC over Streamable HTTP (with SSE) and stdio. You're looking for an *underlying internet protocol* that could serve as a foundation, potentially offering better characteristics or enabling new possibilities for MCP's goals (security, auth, identity primitives for AI interactions).

Let's break down what MCP needs from an underlying protocol and then brainstorm options.

**Key Requirements/Desirables for an Underlying Protocol for MCP:**

1.  **Bidirectional Communication:** MCP has client-to-server requests (tools, resources) and server-to-client requests/notifications (sampling, updates, logging). The current Streamable HTTP + SSE handles this, but a protocol with native bidirectional streams could be cleaner.
2.  **Streaming:** Essential for progress updates, resource subscriptions, and potentially large data transfers (audio, images).
3.  **Multiplexing:** Ability to handle multiple independent logical streams over a single connection (e.g., concurrent tool calls, resource subscriptions, and sampling requests without head-of-line blocking).
4.  **Low Latency:** Especially important for interactive AI experiences.
5.  **Efficiency:** Minimize overhead, especially for frequent, small messages. Binary protocols can help here.
6.  **Security (Transport Layer):** Standard encryption (like TLS) is a must.
7.  **Framing/Message Delimitation:** The protocol should handle how messages are separated. JSON-RPC itself is just a payload format.
8.  **Connection Management:** Handling connection establishment, keep-alives, and teardown.
9.  **Interoperability & Ecosystem:** A protocol with good library support across languages would be beneficial for the "servers easy to build" principle.
10. **Support for Auth/Identity Primitives:** The protocol should allow for auth tokens or other identity information to be passed securely.

**Current MCP Transport Strengths & Weaknesses:**

*   **Streamable HTTP (POST/GET + SSE):**
    *   *Strengths:* Ubiquitous, firewall-friendly, well-understood, leverages existing HTTP infrastructure, OAuth 2.1 fits well.
    *   *Weaknesses:* SSE is server-to-client only (client requests are separate POSTs), can have higher overhead than binary protocols, multiplexing relies on HTTP/2 features if available, but MCP's current spec describes managing multiple SSE connections.
*   **stdio:**
    *   *Strengths:* Simple, efficient for local subprocesses.
    *   *Weaknesses:* Local only, no inherent network security/auth.

**Brainstorming Underlying Protocol Options:**

Given MCP already uses JSON-RPC as the *payload format*, we're primarily looking at transport protocols that can carry these JSON-RPC messages, or protocols that might suggest replacing JSON-RPC with their own RPC mechanism if the benefits are significant.

1.  **WebSockets (over TLS - WSS):**
    *   **Description:** A protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. It's initiated via an HTTP handshake.
    *   **Fit for MCP:**
        *   **Bidirectional:** Native.
        *   **Streaming:** Native.
        *   **Multiplexing:** Not inherently at the WebSocket protocol level for multiple *logical* streams (like gRPC channels). You'd need to implement a sub-protocol over WebSockets for this or use multiple WebSocket connections (which MCP's current HTTP transport already does with SSE).
        *   **Low Latency/Efficiency:** Lower overhead than repeated HTTP requests once the connection is established. Can carry JSON-RPC messages.
        *   **Security:** WSS uses TLS.
        *   **Framing:** Provides message framing.
        *   **Auth:** Initial HTTP handshake can carry auth (e.g., cookies, Authorization header). Tokens can also be sent in the first message over the WebSocket. OAuth flows would still happen out-of-band.
        *   **Considerations:** Would be a direct replacement for the HTTP+SSE transport. Could simplify the server-initiated message flow. MCP's JSON-RPC payload would fit well.

2.  **gRPC (over HTTP/2, which uses TLS):**
    *   **Description:** A high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework. Uses Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) by default for message serialization (binary, efficient) and HTTP/2 for transport.
    *   **Fit for MCP:**
        *   **Bidirectional Streaming:** Natively supported for server, client, and bidirectional streaming.
        *   **Multiplexing:** HTTP/2 provides native multiplexing of streams over a single TCP connection.
        *   **Low Latency/Efficiency:** Binary Protobufs and HTTP/2 header compression lead to high efficiency.
        *   **Security:** Relies on HTTP/2's use of TLS.
        *   **Framing/RPC:** Provides its own RPC mechanism and service definition language (IDL). This would mean replacing JSON-RPC with Protobuf definitions. The existing TypeScript schema could inspire the Protobuf definitions.
        *   **Auth:** Supports various auth mechanisms, including token-based (e.g., passing OAuth tokens in metadata).
        *   **Ecosystem:** Strong multi-language support and code generation.
        *   **Considerations:**
            *   This is a more significant shift as it would involve adopting Protobufs and gRPC service definitions instead of raw JSON-RPC.
            *   "Servers easy to build": Protobufs add a compilation step, but code-gen can simplify server/client stubs.
            *   Could elegantly handle all MCP message types (requests, responses, notifications) as gRPC method calls with different streaming semantics.
            *   The "schema.ts" would become `.proto` files.

3.  **HTTP/3 (over QUIC, which uses TLS):**
    *   **Description:** The next major version of HTTP, using QUIC as its transport protocol instead of TCP. QUIC is built on UDP.
    *   **Fit for MCP:**
        *   **This is more of an evolution of the current HTTP transport rather than a fundamentally different underlying protocol for MCP's application layer.**
        *   **Benefits for MCP (if it sticks with HTTP-based transport):**
            *   Reduced head-of-line blocking (QUIC streams are independent).
            *   Faster connection establishment (0-RTT or 1-RTT).
            *   Connection migration (e.g., switching from Wi-Fi to cellular without dropping the connection).
            *   Built-in TLS 1.3.
        *   **Considerations:** MCP would still use JSON-RPC and the Streamable HTTP mechanism on top. This just makes the "HTTP" part better. Adoption of HTTP/3 is growing but not yet as ubiquitous as HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2.

4.  **MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) (over TCP/TLS):**
    *   **Description:** A lightweight, publish/subscribe network protocol. Often used for IoT.
    *   **Fit for MCP:**
        *   **Bidirectional/Streaming:** Primarily pub/sub, so notifications and updates fit well. RPC-style request/response can be implemented on top (e.g., using dedicated request/response topics).
        *   **Efficiency:** Designed to be lightweight.
        *   **Security:** Supports TLS.
        *   **Auth:** Username/password, client certificates.
        *   **Considerations:**
            *   The pub/sub model is a different paradigm than MCP's current RPC model.
            *   Might be a good fit for highly distributed AI agents or scenarios where many clients subscribe to updates from a few servers, or vice-versa.
            *   Could be overkill or an awkward fit for the direct client-host-server model described.
            *   Less natural for direct request/response interactions than WebSockets or gRPC.

5.  **Custom TCP + MessagePack/CBOR (or other binary JSON-like format):**
    *   **Description:** Roll your own transport over raw TCP sockets, using a binary serialization format for JSON-RPC messages.
    *   **Fit for MCP:**
        *   **Efficiency:** Potentially very high if done right, avoiding HTTP overhead.
        *   **Full Control:** You define everything.
        *   **Considerations:**
            *   Reinventing many wheels: framing, connection management, security (TLS implementation), multiplexing (if needed).
            *   Significantly increases complexity for implementers.
            *   Goes against "servers easy to build" unless a very robust library abstracting this is provided.
            *   Less interoperability out-of-the-box.
            *   JSON-RPC already has batching.

**Analysis & Recommendation Leaning:**

Given MCP's current design and future goals:

*   **If the goal is incremental improvement and maintaining JSON-RPC:**
    *   **WebSockets (WSS)** seems like a strong candidate to replace the Streamable HTTP + SSE transport. It offers native bi-directional communication, is well-supported, and JSON-RPC messages can be sent over it directly. It simplifies the transport logic compared to managing HTTP POSTs and SSE streams separately for full-duplex. Auth can still leverage OAuth (token passed after handshake or in first message).
    *   Adopting **HTTP/3** would be a transport-layer upgrade beneficial if MCP sticks with an HTTP-based approach, improving performance and resilience.

*   **If a more fundamental shift for performance and stronger contracts is acceptable:**
    *   **gRPC** is very compelling. It's designed for this kind of microservice/polyglot communication.
        *   It provides superior performance and efficiency (Protobufs, HTTP/2).
        *   Its native support for all streaming modes and multiplexing is ideal.
        *   Service definitions (`.proto` files) provide a strong contract, similar to the `schema.ts` goal but with more mature tooling for RPC.
        *   The security/auth/identity primitives MCP aims for can be built on top (e.g., OAuth tokens in metadata, mTLS for service identity).
        *   It aligns well with building composable, independent servers.
        *   The learning curve for Protobuf might be a slight barrier to "servers easy to build" compared to plain JSON, but code generation helps immensely.

**How these relate to Security/Auth/Identity Primitives:**

*   **Transport Security:** All viable options (WSS, gRPC over HTTP/2, HTTP/3) mandate or strongly recommend TLS, providing channel encryption, integrity, and server authentication.
*   **Authentication (Client/User):**
    *   MCP currently uses OAuth 2.1. This would largely remain.
    *   With **WebSockets**, the OAuth token obtained via a standard web flow could be sent in the initial HTTP upgrade request or as the first message over the established WebSocket.
    *   With **gRPC**, OAuth tokens are typically passed as metadata with each RPC call or established per-connection. Interceptors can manage this.
*   **Identity:**
    *   OAuth tokens provide user identity.
    *   For *service-to-service* identity (e.g., a Host verifying a Server, or vice-versa, especially in zero-trust environments), **mTLS (mutual TLS)** is a strong primitive. Both gRPC and WebSockets (via the underlying TLS) can support mTLS. This means clients and servers present certificates to each other.
    *   Higher-level identity systems like SPIFFE/SPIRE could be used to issue short-lived certificates for mTLS, especially in dynamic environments like Kubernetes.
    *   The "identity primitive" MCP provides could be an abstraction layer that utilizes these underlying mechanisms. For example, MCP could define how identities (derived from tokens or mTLS certs) are represented and used for authorization decisions within the MCP protocol itself.

**Recommendation:**

1.  **Short-term/Evolutionary:** Consider **WebSockets (WSS)** as a more streamlined transport for JSON-RPC messages, replacing the current Streamable HTTP + SSE. It's a less disruptive change.
2.  **Long-term/Revolutionary:** Evaluate **gRPC**. It offers a more robust and performant foundation if the MCP community is willing to adopt Protobufs. It aligns very well with the architectural goals and the need for security/auth/identity primitives at scale.

The choice depends on how much change is acceptable and the primary pain points with the current transport. If the current HTTP approach is "good enough" but needs performance, then HTTP/3 is the path. If the complexity of managing separate client->server POSTs and server->client SSE streams is an issue, WebSockets is a good fix. If a full-fledged, high-performance RPC system with strong contracts is desired, gRPC is the way to go.

For "higher level security/auth/identity concern," the underlying protocol needs to *support* carrying the necessary credentials and allow for strong transport security. The actual logic and policies would still reside within MCP and its implementations, leveraging these underlying capabilities.
