=== BASIC SYNTAX ===
property_name:[operator]'value'

=== AVAILABLE OPERATORS ===
• No operator = equals (default)
• ! = not equal
• > = greater than
• >= = greater than or equal
• < = less than
• <= = less than or equal
• ~ = text match (ignores case, spaces, punctuation)
• !~ = not text match
• * = wildcard (one or more characters)
• !* = not wildcard (one or more characters)

=== COMBINING CONDITIONS ===
• + = AND condition
• , = OR condition
• ( ) = Group expressions

=== DATA TYPES & SUPPORTED OPERATORS ===
• String: equal, not equal, wildcard.
• Date, Timestamp: equal, not equal, less than, less than or equal, greater than, greater than or equal.
• Boolean: equal, not equal.
• Number: equal, not equal, less than, less than or equal, greater than, greater than or equal.

=== DATA TYPES & SYNTAX ===
• String: 'value' or ['value1', 'value2'] for a list of values. Wildcards: 'partial*' or '*partial' or '*partial*'.
• Date, Timestamp: 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ' (UTC format).
• Boolean: true or false (no quotes).
• Number: 123 (no quotes).

=== IMPORTANT NOTES ===
• Use single quotes around string values: 'value'
• Use square brackets for list of string values: ['value 1', 'value 2']
• Use wildcard operator to determine if a property contains or not a substring. Ex: `property:*'*sub*'`, `property:!*'*sub*'`
• Dates and timestamps format must be UTC: 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ'
