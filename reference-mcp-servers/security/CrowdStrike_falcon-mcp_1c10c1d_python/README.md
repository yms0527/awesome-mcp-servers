## API Credentials & Required Scopes

### Setting Up CrowdStrike API Credentials

Before using the Falcon MCP Server, you need to create API credentials in your CrowdStrike console:

1. **Log into your CrowdStrike console**
2. **Navigate to Support > API Clients and Keys**
3. **Click "Add new API client"**
4. **Configure your API client**:
   - **Client Name**: Choose a descriptive name (e.g., "Falcon MCP Server")
   - **Description**: Optional description for your records
   - **API Scopes**: Select the scopes based on which modules you plan to use (see below)

> **Important**: Ensure your API client has the necessary scopes for the modules you plan to use. You can always update scopes later in the CrowdStrike console.

## Available Modules, Tools & Resources

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ⚠️ **Important Note on FQL Guide Resources**: Several modules include FQL (Falcon Query Language) guide resources that provide comprehensive query documentation and examples. While these resources are designed to assist AI assistants and users with query construction, **FQL has nuanced syntax requirements and field-specific behaviors** that may not be immediately apparent. AI-generated FQL filters should be **tested and validated** before use in production environments. We recommend starting with simple queries and gradually building complexity while verifying results in a test environment first.

**About Tools & Resources**: This server provides both tools (actions you can perform) and resources (documentation and context). Tools execute operations like searching for detections or analyzing threats, while resources provide comprehensive documentation like FQL query guides that AI assistants can reference for context without requiring tool calls.

### Installation

> [!NOTE]
> If you just want to interact with falcon-mcp via an agent chat interface rather than running the server itself, take a look at [Additional Deployment Options](#additional-deployment-options). Otherwise continue to the installations steps below.

#### Install using uv

```bash
uv tool install falcon-mcp
```

#### Install using pip

```bash
pip install falcon-mcp
```

> [!TIP]
> If `falcon-mcp` isn't found, update your shell PATH.

For installation via code editors/assistants, see the [Editor/Assitant](#editorassistant-integration) section below

## Usage

### Command Line

Run the server with default settings (stdio transport):

```bash
falcon-mcp
```

Run with SSE transport:

```bash
falcon-mcp --transport sse
```

Run with streamable-http transport:

```bash
falcon-mcp --transport streamable-http
```

Run with streamable-http transport on custom port:

```bash
falcon-mcp --transport streamable-http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

Run with stateless HTTP mode (for scalable deployments like AWS AgentCore):

```bash
falcon-mcp --transport streamable-http --stateless-http
```

Run with API key authentication (recommended for HTTP transports):

```bash
falcon-mcp --transport streamable-http --api-key your-secret-key
```

> **Security Note**: When using HTTP transports (`sse` or `streamable-http`), consider enabling API key authentication via `--api-key` or `FALCON_MCP_API_KEY` to protect the endpoint. This is a self-generated key (any secure string you create) that ensures only authorized clients with the matching key can access the MCP server when running remotely. This is separate from your CrowdStrike API credentials.

### Module Configuration

The Falcon MCP Server supports multiple ways to specify which modules to enable:

#### 1. Command Line Arguments (highest priority)

Specify modules using comma-separated lists:

```bash
# Enable specific modules
falcon-mcp --modules detections,incidents,intel,spotlight,idp

# Enable only one module
falcon-mcp --modules detections
```

#### 2. Environment Variable (fallback)

Set the `FALCON_MCP_MODULES` environment variable:

```bash
# Export environment variable
export FALCON_MCP_MODULES=detections,incidents,intel,spotlight,idp
falcon-mcp

# Or set inline
FALCON_MCP_MODULES=detections,incidents,intel,spotlight,idp falcon-mcp
```

#### 3. Default Behavior (all modules)

If no modules are specified via command line or environment variable, all available modules are enabled by default.

**Module Priority Order:**

1. Command line `--modules` argument (overrides all)
2. `FALCON_MCP_MODULES` environment variable (fallback)
3. All modules (default when none specified)

### Additional Command Line Options

For all available options:

```bash
falcon-mcp --help
```

### As a Library

```python
from falcon_mcp.server import FalconMCPServer

# Create and run the server
server = FalconMCPServer(
    base_url="https://api.us-2.crowdstrike.com",  # Optional, defaults to env var
    debug=True,  # Optional, enable debug logging
    enabled_modules=["detections", "incidents", "spotlight", "idp"],  # Optional, defaults to all modules
    api_key="your-api-key"  # Optional: API key for HTTP transport auth
)

# Run with stdio transport (default)
server.run()

# Or run with SSE transport
server.run("sse")

# Or run with streamable-http transport
server.run("streamable-http")

# Or run with streamable-http transport on custom host/port
server = FalconMCPServer(host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)
server.run("streamable-http")
```

#### Direct Credentials (Secret Management Integration)

For enterprise deployments using secret management systems (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.), you can pass credentials directly instead of using environment variables:

```python
from falcon_mcp.server import FalconMCPServer

# Example: Retrieve credentials from a secrets manager
# client_id = vault.read_secret("crowdstrike/client_id")
# client_secret = vault.read_secret("crowdstrike/client_secret")

# Create server with direct credentials
server = FalconMCPServer(
    client_id="your-client-id",           # Or retrieved from vault/secrets manager
    client_secret="your-client-secret",   # Or retrieved from vault/secrets manager
    base_url="https://api.us-2.crowdstrike.com",  # Optional
    enabled_modules=["detections", "incidents"]   # Optional
)

server.run()
```

> **Note**: When both direct parameters and environment variables are available, direct parameters take precedence.

### Running Examples

```bash
# Run with stdio transport
python examples/basic_usage.py

# Run with SSE transport
python examples/sse_usage.py

# Run with streamable-http transport
python examples/streamable_http_usage.py
```

### Building Locally (Development)

For development or customization purposes, you can build the image locally:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t falcon-mcp .

# Run the locally built image
docker run --rm -e FALCON_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id -e FALCON_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret falcon-mcp
```

> [!NOTE]
> When using HTTP transports in Docker, always set `--host 0.0.0.0` to allow external connections to the container.

## Editor/Assistant Integration

You can integrate the Falcon MCP server with your editor or AI assistant. Here are configuration examples for popular MCP clients:

### Using `uvx` (recommended)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "falcon-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--env-file",
        "/path/to/.env",
        "falcon-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### With Module Selection

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "falcon-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--env-file",
        "/path/to/.env",
        "falcon-mcp",
        "--modules",
        "detections,incidents,intel"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Using Individual Environment Variables

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "falcon-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["falcon-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "FALCON_CLIENT_ID": "your-client-id",
        "FALCON_CLIENT_SECRET": "your-client-secret",
        "FALCON_BASE_URL": "https://api.crowdstrike.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Docker Version

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "falcon-mcp-docker": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "--env-file",
        "/full/path/to/.env",
        "quay.io/crowdstrike/falcon-mcp:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `-i` flag is required when using the default stdio transport.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all unit tests
pytest

# Run end-to-end tests (requires API credentials)
pytest --run-e2e tests/e2e/

# Run end-to-end tests with verbose output (note: -s is required to see output)
pytest --run-e2e -v -s tests/e2e/

# Run integration tests (requires API credentials)
pytest --run-integration tests/integration/

# Run integration tests with verbose output
pytest --run-integration -v -s tests/integration/

# Run integration tests for a specific module
pytest --run-integration tests/integration/test_detections.py
```

> **Note**: The `-s` flag is required to see detailed output from E2E and integration tests.

#### Integration Tests

Integration tests make real API calls to validate FalconPy operation names, HTTP methods, and response schemas. They catch issues that mocked unit tests cannot detect:

- Incorrect FalconPy operation names (typos)
- HTTP method mismatches (POST body vs GET query parameters)
- Two-step search patterns not returning full details
- API response schema changes

**Requirements**: Valid CrowdStrike API credentials must be configured (see [Environment Configuration](#environment-configuration)).
