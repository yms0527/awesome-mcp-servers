# Understanding JavaScript Async Patterns

JavaScript provides several patterns for handling asynchronous operations:

## 1. Promises
- Clean way to handle async operations
- Chainable with .then()
- Error handling with .catch()
- Can be combined with Promise.all()

## 2. Async/Await
- Syntactic sugar over promises
- Makes async code look synchronous
- Better error handling with try/catch
- Easier to reason about

## 3. Common Patterns
- Sequential execution
- Parallel execution
- Error boundaries
- Cancellation patterns

## Key Insights
- Always handle errors
- Consider performance implications
- Think about error propagation
- Use appropriate patterns for the use case
