# Ask m' AI

**Ask m' AI** (ask my ai -> ask m' ai) is a little Desktop-Chat-Application for LargeLanguageModels (e.g. OpenAI's GPT).

Unlike many chat applications out there, this application aims to be scriptable. 
Which means you can call it from you terminal and gave all necessary options as arguments. 
The conversations will also be printed out in the terminal, so you can use it in your scripts.

## How to build and install this application (flatpak) by yourself

```
flatpak-builder .flatpak-build de.rainu.ask-mai.yml --repo=.flatpak-repo --install-deps-from=flathub --force-clean --default-branch=master --arch=x86_64 --ccache
flatpak build-bundle .flatpak-repo ask-mai.flatpak --runtime-repo=https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo --arch=x86_64 de.rainu.ask-mai master

## Application starts not fast enough

If the application does not start fast enough for your needs, you can get the prompt by your own and use the `-ui-prompt` flag to start the application with that prompt. 
Here is an example with [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi):

```sh
#!/bin/sh

PROMPT=$(rofi -dmenu -p "Ask-mAI" -l 0 -location 2)
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    exit 1
fi

ask-mai -ui-prompt "${PROMPT}"
```

## Contributing

If you use [nix](https://nixos.org/), you can use `nix develop` to enter a shell with all dependencies you need for contributing. The flake also utilises [treefmt](https://github.com/numtide/treefmt-nix) to format all *.nix and *.go files. This can be done with `nix fmt` and checked with `nix flake check`.
