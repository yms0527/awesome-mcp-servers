## NEW - File Attachments (Multimodal Input)

The application now supports attaching files to your chat messages.

### Supported File Types
- ✅ Images: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WEBP (requires a vision-capable model)
- ✅ Documents: PDF (text extracted client-side)
- ✅ Text: TXT, MD

### How To Attach Files
1. Drag and drop files directly onto the chat input, or
2. Use the "📎 Attach files (PDF, TXT, images)" expander above the chat to select multiple files.

Attachments are sent along with your next message and appear in the conversation metadata.

### How It Works
- **Images**: Sent as inline image blocks. Supported by OpenAI GPT-4o/o4 family, Anthropic Claude 3.x, and Google Gemini models. Not supported by Ollama in this app.
- **PDFs**: Text is extracted locally using `pypdf` and included as contextual text alongside your prompt.
- **Text/Markdown**: File contents are read and included as additional text context.

### Provider Support Notes
- **OpenAI**: Use vision-capable models (e.g., gpt-4o, o4-*, gpt-4.1, gpt-4-turbo) for images. Text/PDF work across text models.
- **Anthropic**: Claude 3 family (Sonnet/Opus/Haiku) supports images and text.
- **Google**: Gemini models support images, text, and MCP tool calling.
- **Ollama**: Images not supported here; PDFs/Text are included as text.

## NEW - Streaming Support

The application now supports real-time streaming responses for all compatible models:

### Supported Models with Streaming
- ✅ **OpenAI**: All GPT models (GPT-4o, GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo) + Reasoning models (o3-mini, o4-mini)
- ✅ **Anthropic**: All Claude models (Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3-Opus, Claude-3-Haiku)
- ✅ **Google**: All Gemini models (Gemini-2.0-Flash, Gemini-2.5-Pro-Exp)
- ✅ **Ollama**: All local models (Granite, Qwen, etc.)
- ❌ **OpenAI o1 Series**: o1, o1-mini, o1-preview (not supported due to API limitations)

### How It Works
1. **Enable Streaming**: Toggle in the "🌊 Streaming Settings" section in the sidebar
2. **Real-time Display**: Responses appear token by token as they're generated
3. **Tool Integration**: See tool execution status in real-time
4. **Fallback Support**: Automatically falls back to non-streaming if issues occur

### Benefits
- **Better User Experience**: See responses as they're being generated
- **Faster Perceived Response Time**: Start reading while the model is still generating
- **Real-time Feedback**: Know immediately when tools are being executed
- **Interactive Feel**: More engaging conversation experience

## OpenAI Reasoning Models Support

The application now includes enhanced support for OpenAI's reasoning models with specialized handling:

### Supported Reasoning Models
- ✅ **o3-mini**: Fast reasoning model with streaming support
- ✅ **o4-mini**: Advanced reasoning model with streaming support
- ❌ **o1 Series**: o1, o1-mini, o1-preview (not supported due to unique API requirements)

### Reasoning Model Features
- **Automatic Parameter Optimization**: Uses `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens`
- **Temperature Handling**: Automatically disables temperature for reasoning models (they use fixed temperature)
- **Reasoning Effort**: Automatically sets reasoning effort to "medium" for optimal performance
- **Streaming Support**: o3/o4 series support real-time streaming (o1 series does not)
- **Smart Validation**: Prevents incompatible parameter combinations with clear error messages

### User Experience
- **Clear Warnings**: Visual indicators when selecting reasoning models
- **Alternative Suggestions**: Recommends compatible models when o1 series is selected
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with all existing features (memory, tools, streaming)

## Memory System

### Memory Types

1. **Short-term (Session)**: 
   - Conversations stored in browser session memory
   - Lost when browser is closed or app restarted
   - Uses LangGraph's InMemorySaver

2. **Persistent (Cross-session)**:
   - Conversations stored in SQLite database (`conversations.db`)
   - Persists across browser sessions and app restarts
   - Uses LangGraph's SqliteSaver with custom metadata management
   - Auto-saves conversations during chat
   - Browse, load, and manage saved conversations

### Advanced Memory Features

- **Conversation Import/Export**: Import previous conversations with preview and confirmation system
- **Thread Management**: Switch between different conversation threads with unique IDs
- **Memory Analytics**: Track message counts, memory usage, conversation statistics, and database size
- **Conversation Browser**: View and manage all stored conversations with metadata and search capabilities
- **History Tool Integration**: When memory is enabled, the agent gains access to a `get_conversation_history` tool that allows it to:
  - Search through previous conversations by type or content
  - Reference earlier discussions and maintain context
  - Summarize conversation topics and filter messages
  - Access specific parts of the conversation history with clean, formatted output

### Memory Safety & Performance
- **Import Validation**: Safe import system with format validation and preview before applying
- **Loop Prevention**: Robust safeguards against infinite loops during memory operations
- **Flexible Limits**: Configurable message limits and memory constraints
- **Real-time Status**: Visual indicators for memory state, thread information, and change detection

## Tool Testing & Analytics
- **Individual Tool Testing**: Access via the "🔧 Test Tools" tab
- **Dynamic Parameter Forms**: Auto-generated forms based on tool schemas with real-time validation
- **Performance Tracking**: Execution timing, success/failure rates, and detailed statistics
- **Test History**: Complete test result history with export capabilities
- **Result Analysis**: Success rate calculations and average execution time metrics
- **JSON Export**: Export test results and performance data for external analysis

## Future Improvements

- **STDIO MCP Servers**: Support for connecting to MCP servers using standard input/output (STDIO) for more flexible server configurations
- **RAG (Document Indexing)**: Index and retrieve from uploaded documents across sessions (attachments are supported now; full retrieval remains planned)
- **Enhanced Tool Validation**: Advanced parameter validation and schema checking for MCP tools
- **Multi-threaded Processing**: Parallel processing for multiple tool executions and server connections

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/guinacio/langchain-mcp-client.git
cd langchain-mcp-client
```

### Recommended: Install with UV

UV manages a project-local `.venv` and pins from `pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock`.

```bash
uv sync --all-extras --dev
```

Run the app with UV:

```bash
uv run streamlit run app.py
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:8501

### Alternative: Install with pip and requirements.txt

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Setting Up an MCP Server

To use this application, you'll need an MCP server running or a valid URL to an MCP server.
Use the simple MCP server available on `weather_server.py` for a quick test:

Run with UV (recommended):
```bash
uv run python weather_server.py
```

Alternative (pip/venv):
```bash
python weather_server.py
```

The server will start on port 8000 by default. In the Streamlit app, you can connect to it using the URL `http://localhost:8000/sse`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection Issues**: Ensure your MCP server is running and accessible
- **API Key Errors**: Verify that you've entered the correct API key for your chosen LLM provider
- **Tool Errors**: Check the server logs for details on any errors that occur when using tools
- **Reasoning Model Issues**: 
  - If you see "o1 Series Models Not Supported", use o3-mini or o4-mini instead
  - Reasoning models don't support custom temperature settings
  - Some reasoning models may not support streaming (check the model-specific warnings)
- **Custom Model Names**: When using "Other" option, ensure the model name is exactly as expected by the provider's API, and you have access to it.
- **File Attachments**:
  - Images require a vision-capable model (e.g., GPT-4o/o4, Claude 3.x, Gemini). Ollama is text-only here.
  - PDF text extraction depends on the quality of the PDF; scanned images may yield limited text.
