# Assistant Testing Protocol for Context Optimizer MCP Server

This document provides workflow-based testing that comprehensively validates all tools through realistic scenarios. Execute workflows in order and report results.

Important constraints:
- Do not create any files; use only files already in this repository.
- If a required file for a test is not available, ask the user to provide one or point to an alternative file, then proceed.
- Replace `$PROJECT_ROOT` in all examples with your actual project path (e.g., `/home/user/context-optimizer-mcp-server` on Linux/Mac or `C:\Users\username\context-optimizer-mcp-server` on Windows)

## Notes for Code Assistants

### When Executing This Protocol
1. **Execute workflows in order** - later workflows may depend on earlier ones
2. **Complete entire workflows** before moving to the next
3. **Document all results** - both successes and failures
4. **Note context optimization effectiveness** - are responses focused or verbose?
5. **Test failure scenarios thoroughly** - security is critical
6. **Verify session data persistence** between workflow steps
7. **Monitor for any tool conflicts** or unexpected interactions

### Tips for Effective Testing
- Workflows simulate realistic usage patterns rather than isolated tool testing
- Each workflow tests multiple tools in logical sequences
- Failure scenarios ensure security and error handling work correctly
- Focus on whether context optimization is actually working (responses should be targeted, not comprehensive)
- Validate that tools enhance each other when used together
- Look for any degradation in response quality as workflows progress

This protocol provides comprehensive coverage with 75% fewer test cases while maintaining thorough validation of all functionality through realistic usage scenarios.
