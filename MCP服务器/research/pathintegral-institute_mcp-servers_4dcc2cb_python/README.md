## Quick Start

Running any server in this repository is as simple as a single command. For example, to start the `web-fetch` server:

```bash
uvx mcp-science web-fetch
```

This command handles everything from installation to execution. For more details on configuration and finding other servers, see the "[How to configure MCP servers for AI client apps](#how-to-configure-mcp-servers-for-ai-client-apps)" section below.

## About

This repository contains a collection of open source [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) servers specifically designed for scientific research applications. These servers enable Al models (like Claude) to interact with scientific data, tools, and resources through a standardized protocol.

## What is MCP?

> MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.
>
> MCP helps you build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs. LLMs frequently need to integrate with data and tools, and MCP provides:
>
> - A growing list of pre-built integrations that your LLM can directly plug into
> - The flexibility to switch between LLM providers and vendors
> - Best practices for securing your data within your infrastructure

## How to configure MCP servers for AI client apps

If you're not familiar with these stuff, here is a step-by-step guide for you: [Step-by-step guide to configure MCP servers for AI client apps](./docs/integrate-mcp-server-step-by-step.md)

### Prerequisites

1. [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) ­— a super-fast (Rust-powered) drop-in
   replacement for pip + virtualenv.  Install it with:

   ```bash
   curl -sSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | bash
   ```

2. An MCP-enabled client application such as
   [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download),
   [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/),
   [Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/),
   [5ire](https://5ire.app/).

### The short version – use `uvx`

Any server in this repository can be launched with a single shell command.  The
pattern is:

```bash
uvx mcp-science <server-name>
```

For example, to start the `web-fetch` stdio server locally, configure the following command in your client:

```bash
uvx mcp-science web-fetch
```

Which corresponds to this in claude desktop's json configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "web-fetch": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-science",
        "web-fetch"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The command will download the `mcp-science` package from PyPI and run the requested entry-point.

#### Find other servers

Have a look at the [Available servers](#available-servers-in-this-repo) list —
every entry in the table works with the pattern shown above.

### Optional: managing integrations with MCPM

[MCPM](https://mcpm.sh/) is a convenience command-line tool that can automate
the process of wiring servers into supported clients.  It is not required but
can be useful if you frequently switch between clients or maintain a large
number of servers.

The basic workflow is:

```bash
# Install mcpm first – it is a separate project
uv pip install mcpm

mcpm client ls           # discover supported clients
mcpm client set <name>   # pick the one you are using

# Add a server (automatically installing it if needed)
mcpm add web-fetch
```

After the command finishes, restart your client so that it reloads its tool
configuration.  You can browse the [MCPM Registry](https://mcpm.sh/registry/)
for additional community-maintained servers.

   Please create your new server in the `servers` folder.
   For creating a new server folder under repository folder, you can simply run (replace `your-new-server` with your server name)

   ```sh
   uv init --package --no-workspace servers/your-new-server
   uv add --directory servers/your-new-server mcp
   ```

   This will create a new server folder with the necessary files:

   ```bash
   servers/your-new-server/
   ├── README.md
   ├── pyproject.toml
   └── src
       └── your_new_server

### Contributor Recognition in Subrepos

If you want to recognize contributors for a specific server/subrepo (e.g. `servers/gpaw-computation/`), you can use the [All Contributors CLI](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/cli/installation) in that subdirectory.

**Steps:**

1. In your subrepo (e.g. `servers/gpaw-computation/`), create a `.all-contributorsrc` file (see [example](servers/gpaw-computation/.all-contributorsrc)).
2. Add contributors using the CLI:
   ```bash
   npx all-contributors add <github-username> <contribution-type>
   ```
3. Generate or update the contributors section in the subrepo's `README.md`:
   ```bash
   npx all-contributors generate
   ```
4. Commit the changes to the subrepo's `README.md` and `.all-contributorsrc`.

For more details, see the [All Contributors CLI installation guide](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/cli/installation).
