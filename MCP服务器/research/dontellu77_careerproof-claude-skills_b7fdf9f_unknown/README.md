# CareerProof Skills for Claude Code

## What is CareerProof?

CareerProof is an AI-powered career and workforce intelligence platform built for two audiences navigating the same disruption from opposite sides: **professionals** rethinking their careers in the age of AI, and **organizations** redesigning their workforce to stay competitive.

The platform operates in two modes:

- **CeeVee** (Personal Career Intelligence) — Helps individuals understand how their experience translates in a rapidly shifting market, optimize their positioning, and make data-backed career decisions.
- **Atlas** (Workforce & Org Intelligence) — Gives HR leaders, talent acquisition teams, and consultants the analytical firepower to evaluate candidates, benchmark compensation, plan workforce transitions, and generate research-grade reports on org design, skills gaps, and talent strategy.

Both modes are powered by the same intelligence engine: a curated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) knowledge base drawn from 50+ premium sources — including HBR, McKinsey, BCG, Bain, Deloitte, PwC, Gartner, Forrester, WEF, MIT, and Stanford — combined with live web research via Tavily for real-time market data.

## What's Included

This plugin bundles **everything** you need in a single install:

| Component | What You Get |
|-----------|-------------|
| **6 Skills** | Guided slash-command workflows for career and workforce tasks |
| **42 MCP Tools** | Full CareerProof API as native Claude tools (via remote MCP server) |
| **OAuth Authentication** | Automatic login flow — no API keys to manage |

## Why It Matters

The workforce is being restructured by AI at every level. Job roles are morphing, entire functions are being automated, and organizations need to redesign around capabilities that didn't exist two years ago. CareerProof bridges the gap between individual career navigation and organizational workforce strategy by grounding both in the same deep research:

- **For professionals**: Move beyond generic career advice. Get intelligence calibrated to your actual experience, industry, and seniority — drawn from the same sources that inform executive strategy.
- **For organizations**: Replace gut-feel hiring and ad-hoc workforce planning with structured analysis. Evaluate talent against competency frameworks, benchmark against market data, and generate the kind of research reports that previously required expensive consulting engagements.

## The Intelligence Engine

Every CareerProof skill and tool is backed by a three-layer intelligence stack:

1. **Expert-Curated RAG** — A knowledge base of career, compensation, and workforce intelligence aggregated from premium research sources (McKinsey, BCG, HBR, Gartner, Forrester, WEF, and 50+ others). Updated 3x daily with executive-focused queries spanning 25+ industries.
2. **Live Web Research** — Real-time search and extraction via Tavily APIs, grounded in current market conditions rather than stale training data. Search results are automatically stored back into the knowledge base, making it smarter over time.
3. **CV/Candidate Context** — When available, analysis is calibrated to actual experience: role, seniority, industry, function, skills, and career trajectory. This transforms generic insights into personalized intelligence.

## Installation

### Claude Code (One Command)

```bash
# Add the marketplace and install
/plugin marketplace add dontellu77/careerproof-claude-skills
/plugin install careerproof-skills@careerproof
```

That's it. The plugin installs both the skills and the MCP server connection. On first use, you'll be prompted to authenticate via OAuth — no API keys needed.

### Gemini CLI

**1. Install skills:**

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/dontellu77/careerproof-claude-skills.git
cd careerproof-claude-skills

# Install globally (all projects)
bash gemini/install.sh --global

# Or install to current project only
bash gemini/install.sh
```

Windows:
```powershell
.\gemini\install.ps1 -Global
```

**2. Connect the MCP server:**

Add to your Gemini CLI settings (`~/.gemini/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "careerproof": {
      "url": "https://mcp.careerproof.ai/mcp/bearer",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your CareerProof API key (`cpk_...`).

**3. Verify:** Start Gemini CLI and run `/mcp` to confirm the server is connected.
