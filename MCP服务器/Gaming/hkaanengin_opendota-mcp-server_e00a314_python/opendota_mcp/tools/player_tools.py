        Get complete Dota 2 player profile with overview statistics.

        - "Who is [player]?"
        - "Tell me about [player]"
        - "What's [player]'s profile?"
        - "Show me [player]'s stats"
        - General player information requests
        
        This is the FIRST tool to use when a user mentions a player - it provides
        a comprehensive overview. For detailed analysis of specific aspects, use
        the specialized tools afterward.
        
        Retrieves:
        - Player profile (name, avatar, profile URL)
        - Overall win/loss statistics and win rate
        - Top 10 most played heroes with individual performance metrics

            player_name: The Dota 2 player name to search for
            
        Returns:
            Dictionary containing:

            - profileurl (str): Steam profile URL
            - win_count (int): Total wins
            - lose_count (int): Total losses
            - win_rate (float): Overall win percentage
            - fav_heroes (list): Top 10 heroes, each with:
