BGG MCP provides access to the BoardGameGeek API through the [Model Context Protocol](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol), enabling retrieval and filtering of board game data, user collections, and profiles. The server is implemented in Go, using the [GoGeek](https://github.com/kkjdaniel/gogeek) library, which helps ensure robust API interactions.

Price data is provided by [BoardGamePrices.co.uk](https://boardgameprices.co.uk), offering real-time pricing from multiple retailers.

Game recommendations are powered by [Recommend.Games](https://recommend.games/), which provides algorithmic similarity recommendations based on BoardGameGeek data.

## Installation

> **Authentication Required**: Most BGG MCP tools require authentication to access BoardGameGeek's API. See the [Configuration section](#configuration) below for setup instructions.

### A) Docker (Recommended)

BGG MCP is published to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kdaniel/bgg-mcp) and listed on the [MCP Registry](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry). Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json` (Claude Desktop) or `settings.json` (VS Code / Cursor):

```json
"bgg": {
    "command": "docker",
    "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm",
        "-e", "BGG_API_KEY",
        "-e", "BGG_USERNAME",
        "kdaniel/bgg-mcp"
    ],
    "env": {
        "BGG_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here",
        "BGG_USERNAME": "your_bgg_username"
    }
}
```

> See [Configuration](#configuration) below for details on obtaining a BGG API key and setting up your username.

For more details on connecting MCP servers to your client, see the [official MCP guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/develop/connect-local-servers).

### B) Manual Setup

#### 1. Install Go

You will need to have Go installed on your system to build binary. This can be easily [downloaded and setup here](https://go.dev/doc/install), or you can use the package manager that you prefer such as Brew.

#### 2. Build

The project includes a Makefile to simplify building and managing the binary.

```bash
# Build the application (output goes to build/bgg-mcp)
make build

# Clean build artifacts
make clean

# Both clean and build
make all
```

Or you can simply build it directly with Go...

```bash
go build -o build/bgg-mcp
```

#### 3. Add MCP Config

In the `settings.json` (VS Code / Cursor) or `claude_desktop_config.json` add the following to your list of servers, pointing it to the binary you created earlier, once you load up your AI tool you should see the tools provided by the server connected:

```json
"bgg": {
    "command": "path/to/build/bgg-mcp",
    "args": ["-mode", "stdio"]
}
```

More details for configuring Claude can be [found here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user).

## Configuration

### Authentication

BGG MCP v2.0+ uses the GoGeek v2.0 library which requires authentication for reliable access to BoardGameGeek's API.

You can configure authentication using **either** `BGG_API_KEY` (recommended) or `BGG_COOKIE`:

#### Authentication Setup

##### Option 1: API Key (Recommended)

Get an API key from [BoardGameGeek's API application form](https://boardgamegeek.com/applications) and add it to your configuration:

```json
"bgg": {
    "env": {
        "BGG_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
    }
}
```

##### Option 2: Cookie Authentication

Alternatively, you can use cookie-based authentication:

```json
"bgg": {
    "env": {
        "BGG_COOKIE": "bggusername=user; bggpassword=pass; SessionID=xyz"
    }
}
```

**Note**: If both are provided, `BGG_API_KEY` will be used by default.

### Username Configuration

You can optionally set the `BGG_USERNAME` environment variable to enable "me" and "my" references in queries without needing to explicitly state your username:

```json
"bgg": {
    "env": {
        "BGG_USERNAME": "your_bgg_username",
        "BGG_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
    }
}
```

This enables:

- **Collection queries**: "Show my collection" instead of specifying your username
- **User queries**: "Show my BGG profile"
- **AI assistance**: The AI can automatically use your username for comparisons and analysis

**Note**: When you use self-references (me, my, I) without setting BGG_USERNAME, you'll get a clear error message.
