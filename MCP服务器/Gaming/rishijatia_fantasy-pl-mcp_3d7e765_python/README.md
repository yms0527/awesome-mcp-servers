## Installation

### Option 1: Install from PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
pip install fpl-mcp
```

### Option 1b: Install with Development Dependencies

```bash
pip install "fpl-mcp[dev]"
```

### Option 2: Install from GitHub

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/rishijatia/fantasy-pl-mcp.git
```

### Option 3: Clone and Install Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rishijatia/fantasy-pl-mcp.git
cd fantasy-pl-mcp
pip install -e .
```

## Running the Server

After installation, you have several options to run the server:

### 1. Using the CLI command

```bash
fpl-mcp
```

### 2. Using the Python module

```bash
python -m fpl_mcp
```

### 3. Using with Claude Desktop

Configure Claude Desktop to use the installed package by editing your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:

**Method 1: Using the Python module directly (most reliable)**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fantasy-pl": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "fpl_mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Method 2: Using the installed command with full path (if installed with pip)**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fantasy-pl": {
      "command": "/full/path/to/your/venv/bin/fpl-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/full/path/to/your/venv/bin/fpl-mcp` with the actual path to the executable. You can find this by running `which fpl-mcp` in your terminal after activating your virtual environment.

> **Note:** Using just `"command": "fpl-mcp"` may result in a `spawn fpl-mcp ENOENT` error since Claude Desktop might not have access to your virtual environment's PATH. Using the full path or the Python module approach helps avoid this issue.

## Usage

### In Claude for Desktop

1. Start Claude for Desktop
2. You should see FPL tools available via the hammer icon
3. Example queries:
   - "Compare Mohamed Salah and Erling Haaland over the last 5 gameweeks"
   - "Find all Arsenal midfielders"
   - "What's the current gameweek status?"
   - "Show me the top 5 forwards by points"

#### Fantasy-PL MCP Usage Instructions

#### Basic Commands:
- Compare players: "Compare [Player1] and [Player2]"
- Find players: "Find players from [Team]" or "Search for [Player Name]"
- Fixture difficulty: "Show upcoming fixtures for [Team]"
- Captain advice: "Who should I captain between [Player1] and [Player2]?"

#### Advanced Features:
- Statistical analysis: "Compare underlying stats for [Player1] and [Player2]"
- Form check: "Show me players in form right now"
- Differential picks: "Suggest differentials under 10% ownership"
- Team optimization: "Rate my team and suggest transfers"

#### Tips:
- Be specific with player names for accurate results
- Include positions when searching (FWD, MID, DEF, GK)
- For best captain advice, ask about form, fixtures, and underlying stats
- Request comparison of specific metrics (xG, shots in box, etc.   

### MCP Inspector for Development

For development and testing:

```bash
# If you have mcp[cli] installed
mcp dev -m fpl_mcp

# Or use npx
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector python -m fpl_mcp
```

## Development

### Adding Features

To add new features:

1. Add resource handlers in the appropriate file within `fpl_mcp/fpl/resources/`
2. Add tool handlers in the appropriate file within `fpl_mcp/fpl/tools/`
3. Update the `__main__.py` file to register new resources and tools
4. Test using the MCP Inspector before deploying to Claude for Desktop

## Authentication

To use features requiring authentication (like accessing your team or private leagues), you need to set up your FPL credentials:

```bash
# Run the credential setup tool
fpl-mcp-config setup
```

This interactive tool will:
1. Prompt for your FPL email, password, and team ID
2. Let you choose between storing in config.json or .env file
3. Save credentials securely to ~/.fpl-mcp/

You can test your authentication with:
```bash
fpl-mcp-config test
```

Alternatively, you can manually configure authentication:
1. Create `~/.fpl-mcp/.env` file with:
   ```
   FPL_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
   FPL_PASSWORD=your_password
   FPL_TEAM_ID=your_team_id
   ```
   
2. Or create `~/.fpl-mcp/config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "email": "your_email@example.com",
     "password": "your_password",
     "team_id": "your_team_id"
   }
   ```

3. Or set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export FPL_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
   export FPL_PASSWORD=your_password
   export FPL_TEAM_ID=your_team_id
   ```

## Limitations

- The FPL API is not officially documented and may change without notice
- Only read operations are currently supported

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "spawn fpl-mcp ENOENT" error in Claude Desktop

This occurs because Claude Desktop cannot find the `fpl-mcp` executable in its PATH.

**Solution:** Use one of these approaches:

- Use the full path to the executable in your config file
  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "fantasy-pl": {
        "command": "/full/path/to/your/venv/bin/fpl-mcp"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- Use Python to run the module directly (preferred method)
  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "fantasy-pl": {
        "command": "python",
        "args": ["-m", "fpl_mcp"]
      }
    }
  }
  ```

#### 2. Server disconnects immediately

If the server starts but immediately disconnects:

- Check logs at `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\mcp*.log` (Windows)
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
- Try running the server manually with `python -m fpl_mcp` to see any errors

#### 3. Server not showing in Claude Desktop

If the hammer icon doesn't appear:

- Restart Claude Desktop completely
- Verify your `claude_desktop_config.json` has correct JSON syntax
- Ensure the path to Python or the executable is absolute, not relative
