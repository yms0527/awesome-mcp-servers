## Findings

### FINDING-001: Duplicate cards in search results
**Severity:** low
**Category:** tool-quality
**Details:** Some cards appear twice in search results (e.g., "Collateral Damage", "Alley Armorsmith"). This is because HearthstoneJSON includes multiple versions of cards that were reprinted or changed between sets. The data pipeline uses dbfId as the primary key, but different printings may have different dbfIds. Consider deduplicating by card name in search results, or filtering to only the latest version per card name. Not blocking.

### FINDING-002: analyze_deck not tested with valid deck code
**Severity:** low
**Category:** execution
**Details:** The analyze_deck tool was only tested with an invalid deck code (which correctly returns an error). A live test with a valid deck code would require the server to have card data downloaded from HearthstoneJSON. In production use (after first startup downloads data), the tool will work with real deck codes. The unit tests (110 passing) cover valid deck analysis with in-memory test data.
