# mtg-oracle

MCP server for Magic: The Gathering card data, rules, and deck analysis.

## Stack Profiles

- MCP stack profile: `../../stacks/mcp/`
- TypeScript stack profile: `../../stacks/typescript/`

Read both stack profiles before writing any code.

## Architecture

- **Runtime data**: Downloads Scryfall bulk data on first run, stores in `~/.mtg-oracle/`
- **Does NOT bundle card data** in the npm package — data is fetched at runtime
- **Updates**: Checks Scryfall `bulk-data` metadata endpoint, downloads only if newer
- **Storage**: SQLite via `better-sqlite3` for fast indexed queries
