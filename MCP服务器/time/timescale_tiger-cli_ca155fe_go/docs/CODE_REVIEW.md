# Tiger CLI Comprehensive Code Review

**Date:** August 15, 2025  
**Reviewer:** Claude Code  
**Repository:** tiger-cli  

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive code review identified **12 significant issues** across security, architecture, performance, and code quality categories. The codebase demonstrates good overall architecture patterns and **secure credential handling practices**.

**Risk Distribution:**
- **Critical:** 0 issues 
- **High:** 1 issue (under review) ⬅️ **3 RESOLVED** 
- **Medium:** 6 issues (security, concurrency, error handling, API design)
- **Low:** 2 issues (testing, code quality)

---

## ✅ **Corrected Assessment - No Critical Issues Found**

**Previous Critical Issue Corrected:** The originally identified "credential exposure in process arguments" was a **false positive**. Upon detailed analysis, Tiger CLI correctly implements secure credential handling:

- **Connection string**: Contains only `postgresql://username@host:port/database` (no password)
- **Password handling**: Uses PostgreSQL's standard `PGPASSWORD` environment variable
- **Process visibility**: Command line arguments are safe (`psql postgresql://tsdbadmin@host:5432/tsdb`)
- **Security**: Follows PostgreSQL best practices for credential separation

## High Severity Issues

### 1. **Security - Weak Keyring Service Name Detection** ✅ **FIXED**
**File:** `/Users/cevian/Development/tiger-cli/internal/tiger/cmd/auth.go:27-33`  
**Severity:** High → **RESOLVED**  
**Problem:** Test detection logic previously relied on binary name suffix and command line arguments, which could be easily bypassed.

**Solution Implemented:** Replaced complex detection logic with Go's built-in `testing.Testing()` function:

```go
func getServiceName() string {
    // Use Go's built-in testing detection
    if testing.Testing() {
        return "tiger-cli-test"
    }
    return serviceName
}
```

**Impact:** ✅ **Eliminated** keyring pollution risk during testing and security bypass potential.

### 2. **Architecture - Global Singleton State** ✅ **FIXED**
**File:** `/Users/cevian/Development/tiger-cli/internal/tiger/config/config.go` (previously line 30)  
**Severity:** High → **RESOLVED**  
**Problem:** Global config singleton previously created hidden dependencies and made testing difficult.

**Solution Implemented:** Removed global singleton pattern and implemented proper instantiation:

```go
// Before: Global singleton with caching
var globalConfig *Config

func Load() (*Config, error) {
    if globalConfig != nil {
        return globalConfig, nil  // Return cached instance
    }
    // ... cache new instance in globalConfig
}

// After: Fresh instance creation every time
func Load() (*Config, error) {
    cfg := &Config{
        ConfigDir: GetConfigDir(),
    }
    // Use viper to unmarshal fresh config each time
    if err := viper.Unmarshal(cfg); err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("error unmarshaling config: %w", err)
    }
    return cfg, nil  // Return new instance
}
```

**Impact:** ✅ **Eliminated** race conditions, improved testability, removed hidden dependencies. Each `config.Load()` call now returns a fresh instance based on current viper state.

### 3. **Error Handling - Insufficient Input Validation** ❓ **NEEDS REVIEW**
**File:** `/Users/cevian/Development/tiger-cli/internal/tiger/cmd/db.go:338-353`  
**Severity:** High → **UNDER REVIEW**  
**Problem:** User-provided psql arguments are passed directly without validation or sanitization.

```go
func separateServiceAndPsqlArgs(cmd ArgsLenAtDashProvider, args []string) ([]string, []string) {
    // No validation of psql arguments
    serviceArgs := args[:argsLenAtDash]
    psqlFlags := args[argsLenAtDash:]
    return serviceArgs, psqlFlags
}
```

**Initial Assessment:** Command injection vulnerabilities if malicious arguments are crafted.

**⚠️ REVIEWER NOTE:** This issue requires further evaluation. The security impact may be limited since:
- CLI runs with user privileges (no privilege escalation)
- Users who can inject malicious args can run malicious commands directly
- Main risk may be in scripted/automated usage or web service integrations

**Potential Solutions:**
- Whitelist allowed psql flags for defensive programming
- Add basic input sanitization to prevent accidents in automation
- Document safe usage patterns for integrations

**Action Required:** Please review whether this constitutes a genuine security vulnerability or should be downgraded to a code quality/defensive programming issue.

### 4. **Performance - Resource Leaks in API Client** ✅ **FIXED**
**File:** `/Users/cevian/Development/tiger-cli/internal/tiger/api/client_util.go:22-48`  
**Severity:** High → **RESOLVED**  
**Problem:** HTTP client previously had no connection pooling limits or cleanup, potentially leading to resource exhaustion.

**Solution Implemented:** Added singleton HTTP client with essential resource limits:

```go
// Before: Basic client with no resource limits
httpClient := &http.Client{
    Timeout: 30 * time.Second,
}

// After: Shared client with resource limits
func getHTTPClient() *http.Client {
    httpClientOnce.Do(func() {
        transport := http.DefaultTransport.(*http.Transport).Clone()
        
        // Essential resource limits to prevent exhaustion
        transport.MaxIdleConns = 100        // Limit total idle connections
        transport.MaxIdleConnsPerHost = 10  // Limit per-host idle connections  
        transport.IdleConnTimeout = 90 * time.Second // Clean up idle connections

        sharedHTTPClient = &http.Client{
            Transport: transport,
            Timeout:   30 * time.Second,
        }
    })
    return sharedHTTPClient
}
```

**Impact:** ✅ **Eliminated** resource exhaustion risk, improved performance through connection reuse, and implemented proper connection cleanup while maintaining Go's sensible defaults.

## Medium Severity Issues

### 5. **Security - PGPASSWORD Environment Variable (Standard Practice)**
**File:** `/Users/cevian/Development/tiger-cli/internal/tiger/cmd/db.go:380`  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Problem:** PGPASSWORD is set in the process environment, which follows PostgreSQL's standard authentication practice but could be visible to debugging tools.

```go
psqlCmd.Env = append(os.Environ(), "PGPASSWORD="+password)
```

**Impact:** Limited risk - password visible to process debugging tools, but this is PostgreSQL's recommended practice.  
**Note:** This is the standard and recommended way to pass passwords to PostgreSQL tools. Alternative approaches (pgpass file) are already supported.

### 6. **Concurrency - Global Logger State**
**File:** `/Users/cevian/Development/tiger-cli/internal/tiger/logging/logging.go:10`  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Problem:** Global logger variable could cause race conditions if accessed concurrently.

```go
var logger *zap.Logger
```

**Impact:** Potential race conditions, difficult testing.  
**Solution:** Use dependency injection or ensure thread-safe initialization.

### 7. **Error Handling - Silent Failures**
**File:** `/Users/cevian/Development/tiger-cli/internal/tiger/cmd/auth.go:235`  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Problem:** Keyring deletion errors are silently ignored.

```go
keyring.Delete(getServiceName(), username) // Error ignored
```

**Impact:** Users may think credentials are removed when they're still present.  
**Solution:** Log errors or inform users of partial cleanup failures.

### 8. **API Design - Inconsistent Error Handling**
**File:** `/Users/cevian/Development/tiger-cli/internal/tiger/cmd/service.go:784-791`  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Problem:** Password saving failures don't fail the overall command, leading to inconsistent state.

```go
func handlePasswordSaving(service api.Service, initialPassword string, cmd *cobra.Command) {
    if err := SavePasswordWithMessages(service, initialPassword, cmd.OutOrStdout()); err != nil {
        // Error ignored - doesn't fail the command
    }
}
```

**Impact:** Users may think password was saved when it wasn't.  
**Solution:** Make password save failures more visible or provide retry mechanisms.

### 9. **Code Quality - Complex Functions**
**File:** `/Users/cevian/Development/tiger-cli/internal/tiger/cmd/service.go:435-563`  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Problem:** `buildServiceUpdatePasswordCmd` function is overly complex (128 lines) with multiple responsibilities.

**Impact:** Difficult to maintain, test, and debug.  
**Solution:** Break into smaller, focused functions.

### 10. **Code Quality - Complex Functions (Service Create)**
**File:** `/Users/cevian/Development/tiger-cli/internal/tiger/cmd/service.go:285-434`  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Problem:** `buildServiceCreateCmd` function is very long with multiple responsibilities.

**Impact:** Difficult to maintain and test.  
**Solution:** Extract validation, API call, and response handling into separate functions.

---

## Low Severity Issues

### 11. **Testing - Incomplete Error Coverage**
**File:** Various test files  
**Severity:** Low  
**Problem:** Many test files don't adequately test error conditions and edge cases.

**Impact:** Reduced confidence in error handling robustness.  
**Solution:** Implement comprehensive error condition testing.

### 12. **Code Quality - TODO Comments**
**File:** `/Users/cevian/Development/tiger-cli/internal/tiger/cmd/auth.go:186`  
**Severity:** Low  
**Problem:** Unimplemented functionality with TODO comment.

```go
// TODO: Make API call to get user information
```

**Impact:** Incomplete user experience.  
**Solution:** Implement user information retrieval or remove the comment.
