# Getting Started with Lemonade Server

🍋 Lemonade Server is a server interface that uses the standard Open AI API, allowing applications to integrate with local LLMs. This means that you can easily replace cloud-based LLMs with private and free LLMs that run locally on your own PC's NPU and GPU.

Lemonade Server is available as a standalone tool with a [one-click Windows GUI installer](https://github.com/lemonade-sdk/lemonade/releases/latest/download/lemonade-server-minimal.msi). Installers are also available for [Linux](https://lemonade-server.ai/install_options.html#linux) and [macOS (beta)](https://lemonade-server.ai/install_options.html#macos).

## Integrate Lemonade Server with Your Application

Since Lemonade Server implements the standard OpenAI API specification, you can use any OpenAI-compatible client library by configuring it to use `http://localhost:8000/api/v1` as the base URL. A table containing official and popular OpenAI clients on different languages is shown below.

Feel free to pick and choose your preferred language.


| Python | C++ | Java | C# | Node.js | Go | Ruby | Rust | PHP |
|--------|-----|------|----|---------|----|-------|------|-----|
| [openai-python](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) | [openai-cpp](https://github.com/olrea/openai-cpp) | [openai-java](https://github.com/openai/openai-java) | [openai-dotnet](https://github.com/openai/openai-dotnet) | [openai-node](https://github.com/openai/openai-node) | [go-openai](https://github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai) | [ruby-openai](https://github.com/alexrudall/ruby-openai) | [async-openai](https://github.com/64bit/async-openai) | [openai-php](https://github.com/openai-php/client) |


### Python Client Example
```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize the client to use Lemonade Server
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8000/api/v1",
    api_key="lemonade"  # required but unused
)

# Create a chat completion
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Hybrid",  # or any other available model
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}
    ]
)

# Print the response
print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```
