- `available_regions` tool — list markets grouped by region
- `recent_news` tool — latest news articles across all tracked stocks

  - `screener_put_call_ratio`, `screener_linkedin`, `screener_app_ratings`

- **BREAKING:** Migrated from FinBrain API v1 to v2
  - The `market` parameter has been removed from all per-symbol tool inputs (`news_sentiment_by_ticker`, `app_ratings_by_ticker`, `analyst_ratings_by_ticker`, `house_trades_by_ticker`, `senate_trades_by_ticker`, `insider_transactions_by_ticker`, `linkedin_metrics_by_ticker`, `options_put_call`)
