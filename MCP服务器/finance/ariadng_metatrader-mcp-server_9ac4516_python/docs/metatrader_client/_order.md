## Class Overview 🏗️

```python
from metatrader_client.client_order import MT5Order
```

- **Class:** `MT5Order`
- **Location:** `src/metatrader_client/client_order.py`
- **Dependencies:** [MetaTrader5 Python package](https://pypi.org/project/MetaTrader5/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

## Initialization ⚙️

To use `MT5Order`, you need an active connection via `MT5Connection`:

```python
from metatrader_client.client_connection import MT5Connection
from metatrader_client.client_order import MT5Order

conn = MT5Connection(config)
if conn.connect():
    order = MT5Order(conn)
```

## Example Usage 💡

```python
from metatrader_client.client_connection import MT5Connection
from metatrader_client.client_order import MT5Order

config = {"login": 12345678, "password": "your_password", "server": "Broker-Server"}
conn = MT5Connection(config)
if conn.connect():
    order = MT5Order(conn)
    print(order.get_all_positions())
    order.place_market_order(type="buy", symbol="EURUSD", volume=0.1)
    order.close_all_profitable_positions()
    conn.disconnect()
else:
    print("Failed to connect. 🚨")
```

## Troubleshooting & Tips 🛡️
- Ensure the [MetaTrader5 Python package](https://pypi.org/project/MetaTrader5/) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) are installed.
- Always connect using `MT5Connection` before creating an `MT5Order` instance.
- Use the `debug` flag in your connection config for more verbose logging.
- Use DataFrame outputs for easy analysis and reporting.
- Double-check symbol names, order types, and volumes before placing orders.
