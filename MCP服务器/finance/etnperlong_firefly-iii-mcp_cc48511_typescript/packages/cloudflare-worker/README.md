## Deployment Methods

### One-Click Deployment

The simplest method is to use the "Deploy to Cloudflare Workers" button for one-click deployment:

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/etnperlong/firefly-iii-mcp/tree/main/packages/cloudflare-worker)

### Manual Deployment

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/etnperlong/firefly-iii-mcp.git
   cd firefly-iii-mcp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:
   ```bash

   npm run deploy
   ```

## Configuration

After deployment, you need to configure the following environment variables in your Cloudflare Workers settings:

### Required Variables

- `FIREFLY_III_BASE_URL`: Your Firefly III instance URL (e.g., `https://firefly.yourdomain.com`)
- `FIREFLY_III_PAT`: Your Firefly III Personal Access Token

### Optional Variables

- `FIREFLY_III_PRESET`: Tool preset to use (default, full, basic, budget, reporting, admin, automation)
- `FIREFLY_III_TOOLS`: Comma-separated list of tool tags to enable (overrides FIREFLY_III_PRESET if both are set)

#### Available Presets

- `default`: Basic tools for everyday use (accounts, bills, categories, tags, transactions, search, summary)
- `full`: All available tools
- `basic`: Core financial management tools
- `budget`: Budget-focused tools
- `reporting`: Reporting and analysis tools
- `admin`: Administration tools
- `automation`: Automation-related tools

### Configuration Steps

1. Go to your Cloudflare dashboard
2. Navigate to Workers & Pages
3. Select your deployed Worker
4. Go to Settings > Variables
5. Add the required and optional variables as secret variables

## Usage

Once deployed and configured, you can access the MCP server at the following URL:

```
https://your-worker-name.your-account.workers.dev/mcp
```

You can provide this URL to MCP-compatible AI tools to enable them to interact with your Firefly III instance.

## Custom Domain

If you want to use your own domain, you can configure a custom domain in the Cloudflare Workers settings. For specific steps, please refer to the [Cloudflare documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/routing/custom-domains/).
