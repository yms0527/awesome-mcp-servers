## review

Reviews your app and provides specific instructions and examples for building and deploying apps that will successfully deploy to the Endgame platform based on the context you provide.

### Usage Guidelines

- ALWAYS call the "review" tool before calling the "deploy" tool to ensure deployment is successful
- ALWAYS include any and all frameworks, languages, and package managers used in the app
- GENERALLY call the "review" tool before starting development to get to know how to build and deploy your app to ensure the work is compliant with the Endgame platform
- If no .endgame file exists in the appSourcePath, an error will be thrown asking you to call this tool again with an "appName" parameter
