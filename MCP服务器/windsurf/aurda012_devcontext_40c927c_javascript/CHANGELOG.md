### Fixed

- Critical bug: Resolved issue with client closing during tool calls when processing multiple code changes
- Added robust error handling and retry logic in database connection code with exponential backoff
- Fixed column name mismatch in KnowledgeProcessor.js where the query was using "path" instead of "file_path"

## 1.0.4 - 2024-05-08

### Enhanced

- Completely refactored message processing logic in `updateConversationContext.tool.js` with a message-first approach

- Messages are now properly associated with their topics through database updates
- Enhanced purpose detection and tracking with support for trigger message IDs
- Implemented user-by-user message processing to properly handle topic shifts on a per-message basis
