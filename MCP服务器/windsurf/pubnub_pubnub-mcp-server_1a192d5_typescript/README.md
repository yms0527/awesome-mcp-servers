# PubNub MCP Server v2

This repository provides a CLI-based Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes [PubNub SDK documentation](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/sdks) and PubNub API resources to LLM-powered tools. This improves the LLM AI Agent's ability to understand and interact with PubNub's SDKs and APIs.

## Quick Start

### API Key

Before you begin, we highly recommend [creating a Service Integration](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/general/portal/service-integrations#create-a-service-integration) in the PubNub Admin Portal and providing your API key to the MCP server. While some basic features will work without it, adding an API key unlocks much more functionality. Alternatively, refer to [Advanced Usage](#advanced-usage) for instructions on configuring the server to work with a single PubNub keyset.

The installation process for an MCP server depends on the AI assistant you’re using. For the standard setup, you’ll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v20.0.0 or higher).

### VS Code

[![Open in VS Code](https://github.com/pubnub/pubnub-mcp-server/raw/main/images/add-to-vscode.png)](https://vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=PubNub&inputs=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22id%22%3A%22pubnub-api-key%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22PubNub%20API%20Key%22%7D%5D&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22%40pubnub%2Fmcp%40latest%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22PUBNUB_API_KEY%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3Apubnub-api-key%7D%22%7D%7D)

Just click the link above, then select “Open in Visual Studio Code” on the page that appears. Back in VS Code, click “Install”. You’ll be prompted to enter your PubNub API Key. Once provided, your MCP server is ready to use. For additional configuration options, refer to [Advanced usage](#advanced-usage).

### Cursor

[![Add to Cursor](https://github.com/pubnub/pubnub-mcp-server/raw/main/images/add-to-cursor.png)](https://tinyurl.com/pubnub-mcp-v2)

Click the link above, then select "Open Cursor" on the page that appears. Back in Cursor, there's a "Install MCP Server?" prompt. Make sure to provide the value for variable holding your PubNub API Key. Once you do, click "Install". Your MCP server is now ready to use. For additional configuration options, refer to [Advanced usage](#advanced-usage).

### Claude Code

With Claude Code installed run this command to have the MCP added to your configuration. Make sure to replace the value of `<your-api-key>`:

```bash
claude mcp add PubNub --env PUBNUB_API_KEY=<your-api-key> --scope user --transport stdio -- npx -y @pubnub/mcp@latest
```

Server is added in the "User" scope which means it will be available accross all projects. For additional configuration options, refer to [Advanced usage](#advanced-usage).

### Codex

With Codex installed run this command to have the MCP added to your configuration. Make sure to replace the value of `<your-api-key>`:

```bash
codex mcp add PubNub --env PUBNUB_API_KEY=<your-api-key> -- npx -y @pubnub/mcp@latest
```

For additional configuration options, refer to [Advanced usage](#advanced-usage).

### Gemini CLI

Gemini CLI does not support automatic MCP installations. You'll have manually edit your [settings.json](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/settings/) file and add the section below. Make sure to replace the value of `<your-api-key>`:

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "pubnub": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "-y",
      "@pubnub/mcp@latest"
    ],
    "env": {
      "PUBNUB_API_KEY": "<your-api-key>"
    }
  }
}
```

For additional configuration options, refer to [Advanced usage](#advanced-usage).

## Advanced usage

### Configuration

- **`PUBNUB_API_KEY`** - Your PubNub API Key. Required for all operations related to your account/keyset
- **`PUBNUB_PUBLISH_KEY`** - Optional PubNub publish key for real-time operations
- **`PUBNUB_SUBSCRIBE_KEY`** - Optional PubNub subscribe key for real-time operations
- **`PUBNUB_USER_ID`** - Optional variable that can be provided to change the User ID for the SDK (real-time) operations (default: `pubnub-mcp`)
- **`PUBNUB_EMAIL`** - (Deprecated - use API Key instead) Your PubNub account email. Required for all operations related to your account/keyset
- **`PUBNUB_PASSWORD`** - (Deprecated - use API Key instead) Your PubNub account password. Required for all operations related to your account/keyset

### PubNub Keys Configuration

The MCP server supports two modes for handling PubNub publish/subscribe keys:

#### Dynamic Mode (No env keys set)

When `PUBNUB_PUBLISH_KEY` and `PUBNUB_SUBSCRIBE_KEY` are **not provided**, the server operates in dynamic mode:

- Tools will request keys as parameters in each call
- The AI agent can work with **multiple keysets** in a single session
- Keys can be discovered dynamically via `manage_keysets` tool
- More autonomous - the agent decides which keyset to use based on context

This mode is ideal when you want the AI to help manage multiple applications or when the keyset should be determined at runtime.

#### Fixed Mode (Env keys set)

When both `PUBNUB_PUBLISH_KEY` and `PUBNUB_SUBSCRIBE_KEY` are **provided**, the server operates in fixed mode:

- PubSub Keys parameters are **hidden** from tool schemas entirely
- All real-time operations use the configured keys automatically
- Operations are **limited to a single keyset**

This mode is ideal for focused workflows where you're working with a specific application and want streamlined interactions.

**Example configuration with fixed keys:**

```json
{
  "env": {
    "PUBNUB_API_KEY": "<your-api-key>",
    "PUBNUB_PUBLISH_KEY": "pub-c-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "PUBNUB_SUBSCRIBE_KEY": "sub-c-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  }
}
```

### Docker-Based Usage

If you prefer to run the MCP server via Docker, use the snippet below in your editor's config file `mcpServers` or `servers` section of the mcp.json:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "PubNub": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "PUBNUB_API_KEY",
        "pubnub/pubnub-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PUBNUB_API_KEY": "<your-api-key>",
      }
    }
  }
}
```
