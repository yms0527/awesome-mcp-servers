cd google-ad-manager-mcp

# Create virtual environment

gam-mcp
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### General

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guidelines
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

### Formatting

We recommend using:
- [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting and formatting
- Line length: 88 characters (Black default)

### Naming Conventions

- Functions: `snake_case`
- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Private methods: `_leading_underscore`

### Documentation

- Update README.md if adding new tools or features
- Include docstrings with Args, Returns, and example usage where helpful
- Update CHANGELOG.md for user-facing changes

## Adding New Tools

When adding a new MCP tool:

1. Create or update the appropriate file in `src/gam_mcp/tools/`
2. Register the tool in `src/gam_mcp/server.py`
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Use parameterized queries (bind variables) for GAM API calls
5. Return structured dict responses
6. Add tests for the new tool
7. Document the tool in README.md

### Tool Template

```python
@mcp.tool()
def your_new_tool(param1: str, param2: int = 10) -> dict:
    """
    Brief description of what the tool does.

    Args:
        param1: Description of param1
        param2: Description of param2 (default: 10)

    Returns:
        dict with keys:
            - key1: description
            - key2: description
    """
    client = get_client()

    # Implementation

    return {
        "key1": value1,
        "key2": value2,
    }
```

## Security

- Never commit credentials or secrets
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks
- Report security vulnerabilities privately to youssef@matious.com
