  - Customer ID
  - Conversation state
- Secure access using your Intercom API key
- Rich conversation data including:
  - Basic conversation details
  - Contact information
  - Statistics (responses, reopens)
  - State and priority information

cd mcp-intercom
```

2. Install dependencies:

3. Set up your environment:
```bash

```

4. Add your Intercom API key to `.env`:
```

```

5. Build the server:
```bash
npm run build
```

- API key should be stored securely in environment variables
- The server only provides read access to conversations
- All API requests are made with proper authentication
