    """
    Deletes specified files in a GitHub repository from a specified branch.

    This function first checks if a confirmation token is provided. If not, it generates a token based on the file paths and repository parameters.
    The user must then confirm the deletion using this token. If the token is provided, the function validates it against the original request parameters before proceeding with the deletion.
    The token is valid for a specified duration.

    Args:
    - repo (str): The GitHub repository in the format 'owner/repo'.
    - file_paths (List[str]): A list of paths of the files to delete, including the filenames.
    - confirmation_token (Optional[str]): An optional token to confirm the deletion. If not provided, a token will be generated based on the file paths and repository.
    - branch (Optional[str]): The branch from which to delete the files (default is 'main').

    Examples Correct Request:

    User: "Delete files file1.txt and file2.txt for repository owner/repo"
    # Generate confirmation token to use for next request
    Assistant Action: `delete_files_tool(repo="owner/repo", file_paths=["file1.txt", "file2.txt"])`
    Assistant Response: "Please confirm deletion of files file1.txt and file2.txt"
    User: "I confirm"
    # Use the confirmation token from the previous request
    Assistant Action: `delete_files_tool(repo="owner/repo", file_paths=["file1.txt", "file2.txt"], confirmation_token="XXXYYY")`
    Assistant Response: "The files file1.txt and file2.txt were deleted successfully."

    Incorrect Request:

    Example 1:
    User: "Delete files file1.txt and file2.txt for repository owner/repo"
    Assistant Action: `delete_files_tool(repo="owner/repo", file_paths=["file1.txt", "file2.txt"], confirmation_token="made_up_token")`
    Server Response: Error: Invalid confirmation token. Please provide a valid token to confirm deletion.
    What went wrong: Instead of requesting a token and asking for confirmation, a made-up token was sent.
    Example 2:
    User: "Delete files file1.txt and file2.txt for repository owner/repo"
    # Generate confirmation token to use for next request
    Assistant Action: `delete_files_tool(repo="owner/repo", file_paths=["file1.txt", "file2.txt"])`
    Assistant Action: `delete_files_tool(repo="owner/repo", file_paths=["file1.txt", "file2.txt"], confirmation_token="XXXYYY")`
    What went wrong: Confirmation token was used without asking for confirmation.

    Returns:
    - JSON string indicating success or error.
