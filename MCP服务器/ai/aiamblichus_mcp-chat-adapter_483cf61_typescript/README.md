# MCP Chat Adapter

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides a clean interface for LLMs to use chat completion capabilities through the MCP protocol. This server acts as a bridge between an LLM client and any OpenAI-compatible API. The primary use case is for **chat models**, as the server does not provide support for text completions.

## Overview

The OpenAI Chat MCP Server implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing language models to interact with OpenAI's chat completion API in a standardized way. It enables seamless conversations between users and language models while handling the complexities of API interactions, conversation management, and state persistence.

## Features

- Built with [FastMCP](https://github.com/punkpeye/fastmcp) for robust and clean implementation
- Provides tools for conversation management and chat completion
- Proper error handling and timeouts
- Supports conversation persistence with local storage
- Easy setup with minimal configuration
- Configurable model parameters and defaults
- Compatible with OpenAI and OpenAI-compatible APIs

## Typical Workflow

The idea is that you can have Claude spin off and maintain multiple conversations with other models in the background. All conversations are stored in the `CONVERSATION_DIR` directory, which you should set in the `env` section of your `mcp.json` file. 

It is possible to tell Claude either to create a new conversation, or to continue an existing one (identified by the integer `conversation_id`). You can continue with the old conversation even if you are starting fresh in a new context, although in that case you may want to tell Claude to read the old conversation before continuing using the `get_conversation` tool. 

Note that you can also edit the conversations in the `CONVERSATION_DIR` directory manually. In this case, you may need to restart the server to see the changes.

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

These environment variables must be set for the server to function:

```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key  # Your API key for OpenAI or compatible service
OPENAI_API_BASE=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1 # The base URL for the API (can be changed for compatible services)
```

You should also set the `CONVERSATION_DIR` environment variable to the directory where you want to store the conversation data. Use an absolute path.

### Optional Environment Variables

The following environment variables are optional and have default values:

```sh
# Model Configuration
DEFAULT_MODEL=google/gemini-2.0-flash-001 # Default model to use if not specified
DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT="You are an unhelpful assistant."  # Default system prompt
DEFAULT_MAX_TOKENS=50000 # Default maximum tokens for completion
DEFAULT_TEMPERATURE=0.7  # Default temperature setting
DEFAULT_TOP_P=1.0 # Default top_p setting
DEFAULT_FREQUENCY_PENALTY=0.0 # Default frequency penalty
DEFAULT_PRESENCE_PENALTY=0.0  # Default presence penalty

# Storage Configuration
CONVERSATION_DIR=./convos # Directory to store conversation data
MAX_CONVERSATIONS=1000 # Maximum number of conversations to store
```

### Integrating with Claude UI etc.

Your `mcp.json` file should look like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chat-adapter": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-chat-adapter"
      ],
      "env": {
          "CONVERSATION_DIR": "/Users/aiamblichus/mcp-convos",
          "OPENAI_API_KEY": "xoxoxo",
          "OPENAI_API_BASE": "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
          "DEFAULT_MODEL": "qwen/qwq-32b"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The latest version of the package is published to npm [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-chat-adapter).

## Available Tools

### 1. Create Conversation
