- [2025-03-09 6:58:46 PM] [@movibe](https://github.com/movibe) - Translated Test Coverage Documentation: Translated the test-coverage.md file from Portuguese to English. The document now provides information about the test status, code coverage, implemented tests, and areas for improvement in English, ensuring consistency with the project's language guidelines.
- [2025-03-09 6:57:26 PM] [@movibe](https://github.com/movibe) - Updated Memory Bank Files: Translated all Portuguese content in Memory Bank files to English. Updated active-context.md, progress.md, and decision-log.md to ensure all entries are in English. This ensures consistency across all Memory Bank files and aligns with the project's development guidelines that specify all content should be in English.
- [2025-03-09 6:55:00 PM] [@movibe](https://github.com/movibe) - Refined Logging System: Refined the logging system by adjusting log levels to ensure appropriate visibility of messages. Changed many INFO level logs to DEBUG level to ensure they only appear in debug mode. This includes initialization details, configuration values, path information, and Memory Bank detection messages. Updated the logging system documentation with detailed examples of appropriate log levels and clarified what is shown in normal mode versus debug mode. These changes ensure a cleaner output in production environments while still providing detailed information when needed for debugging.
- [2025-03-09 6:52:08 PM] [@movibe](https://github.com/movibe) - Decision Made: Logging System Implementation Approach
- [2025-03-09 6:52:02 PM] [@movibe](https://github.com/movibe) - Implemented Logging System: Created a centralized logging system with support for different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) and debug mode. Implemented a LogManager class using the singleton pattern to manage logs across the application. Modified the code to use the new logging system instead of direct console.error calls. Added command line support for enabling debug mode with --debug or -d flag. Created documentation explaining the logging system in docs/logging-system.md and updated the documentation index.
- [2025-03-09 6:46:21 PM] [@movibe](https://github.com/movibe) - Decision Made: Memory Bank Status Detection Fix Approach
- [2025-03-09 6:46:08 PM] [@movibe](https://github.com/movibe) - Fixed Memory Bank Status Detection: Fixed the issue with Memory Bank status detection where the Memory Bank was being found but its status was not being set to ACTIVE. Modified the isMemoryBank method to check for each core file individually using FileUtils.fileExists() instead of relying on the list of files. Enhanced the setCustomPath method to update the Memory Bank status immediately after finding a valid Memory Bank. Improved error handling in the initializeModeManager method. Created documentation on the fix in docs/memory-bank-status-fix.md and updated the documentation index.
- [2025-03-09 6:25:57 PM] [@movibe](https://github.com/movibe) - Decision Made: Approach for Unit Test Correction
- [2025-03-09 6:25:47 PM] [@movibe](https://github.com/movibe) - Executed Unit Tests and Updated Coverage: Executed the project's unit tests, identified and fixed issues in several failing tests. Created a test coverage document to record the current status and next steps to improve coverage.

- [2025-03-09 6:16:20 PM] [@movibe](https://github.com/movibe) - File Update: Updated docs/english-language-policy.md
- [2025-03-09 6:13:32 PM] [@movibe](https://github.com/movibe) - Bug Fix: Fixed the issue where Memory Bank files were being created in the project root instead of using the directory + folder name. Modified the setCustomPath, findMemoryBankDir, and initializeMemoryBank methods to combine the base path with the folderName.
- [2025-03-09 6:13:29 PM] [@movibe](https://github.com/movibe) - Decision Made: Memory Bank Path Correction to Use folderName
- [2025-03-08 5:26:20 PM] [@movibe](https://github.com/movibe) - Updated Memory Bank Documentation: Updated the Memory Bank Structure section in system-patterns.md to reflect the correct file naming convention (kebab-case). Changed references from camelCase (productContext.md, activeContext.md, decisionLog.md, systemPatterns.md) to kebab-case (product-context.md, active-context.md, decision-log.md, system-patterns.md) to match the actual file names used in the Memory Bank.
- [2025-03-08 5:23:30 PM] [@movibe](https://github.com/movibe) - Decision Made: Memory Bank Directory Structure Simplification
- [2025-03-08 5:23:24 PM] [@movibe](https://github.com/movibe) - Fixed Memory Bank Directory Structure: Fixed the Memory Bank initialization to prevent creation of unnecessary subdirectories and duplicate files. The function initializeMemoryBank was creating subdirectories (progress, decisions, context, templates, backups, modes) and placing files in those subdirectories, but the rest of the code expected the files to be in the root directory of the Memory Bank. Modified the function to create all core files directly in the root directory, which is consistent with how the files are accessed throughout the codebase. Removed all duplicate directories and files that were previously created.
- [2025-03-08 5:19:09 PM] [@movibe](https://github.com/movibe) - Removed Environment Variables Support: Removed all support for environment variables from the codebase and documentation. This included removing references to MEMORY_BANK_PROJECT_PATH, MEMORY_BANK_FOLDER_NAME, MEMORY_BANK_MODE, and MEMORY_BANK_USER_ID from the code and documentation. Updated the README.md, custom-folder-name.md, and memory-bank-path-changes.md files to reflect this change. Removed the environment-variables.md documentation file. Removed the handleSetEnvironmentVariable function and its references from the codebase. This simplifies the configuration approach and makes the documentation clearer.
- [2025-03-08 5:19:03 PM] [@movibe](https://github.com/movibe) - Decision Made: Removal of Environment Variables Support

The build completed successfully, confirming that all type definitions are correct and there are no type errors. The tests also ran successfully with only one test failing due to an unrelated issue with file permissions. The implementation of discriminated union types, utility types, type-safe constants, and runtime type guards has been successfully integrated into the codebase without breaking existing functionality.
- [2025-03-08 11:40:41 AM] - Advanced Type Safety Implementation: Implemented comprehensive type safety improvements across the codebase. Created a structured type system with dedicated files for different domains: progress.ts for tracking-related types, rules.ts for rule-related types, utils.ts for utility types, constants.ts for type-safe constants, and guards.ts for runtime type validation. Implemented discriminated union types for progress details, utility types using TypeScript's type system features, type-safe constants with 'as const' assertions, and runtime type guards for validation. These improvements provide better type safety, improved IDE support, and runtime validation capabilities.
- [2025-03-08 11:38:47 AM] - Advanced Type Safety Improvements: Started implementing advanced type safety improvements as outlined in the updated code improvements document. Created a dedicated types directory structure with separate files for different domains (rules.ts, index.ts). Replaced 'any' types with specific interfaces and improved type definitions with proper JSDoc comments. Implemented a more organized approach to type exports to avoid circular dependencies. These changes make the code more maintainable, easier to understand, and less prone to runtime errors.
- [2025-03-08 11:33:35 AM] - Type Safety Improvements: Implemented type safety improvements as described in the code improvements document. Added detailed interfaces for data structures (ProgressDetails, Decision, ActiveContext, MemoryBankConfig, MemoryBankStatus, ModeState, ValidationResult) with proper JSDoc comments. Replaced generic 'any' types with specific interfaces and improved method signatures with more specific parameter and return types. Created a central types file to export all interfaces for use throughout the codebase. Updated methods to use these interfaces for better type safety.
- [2025-03-08 11:27:31 AM] - Memory Bank Files Translation: Updated all Memory Bank files to ensure they are in English.
