## Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

1. Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services
2. Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder
3. Provide us with a reasonable amount of time to resolve vulnerabilities prior to any disclosure to the public or a third-party
4. Do not exploit a security issue for purposes other than immediate testing

## Security Controls

The MCP Teams Server implements several security controls:

1. All authentication tokens and credentials must be provided via environment variables
2. Communications with the Teams API use HTTPS/TLS encryption
3. Input validation and sanitization for all API endpoints
4. Rate limiting to prevent abuse
5. Regular security updates and dependency checks

## Security-related Configuration

For secure operation, please ensure:

1. Environment variables are properly secured and not logged
2. Access tokens have minimum required permissions
3. Production deployments use HTTPS/TLS
4. Regular security updates are applied
5. Proper logging and monitoring is configured

## Third-party Security Notifications

We review security reports for our dependencies and follow responsible disclosure guidelines.
