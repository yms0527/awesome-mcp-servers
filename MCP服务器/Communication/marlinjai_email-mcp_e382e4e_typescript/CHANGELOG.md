## [1.2.8] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **Root cause fix for iCloud Junk/Trash "Invalid message number"** — `fetchEmails()` now uses `fetchAll()` with `{ uid: true }` option instead of `for await ... fetch()`. The original code passed UID arrays without telling ImapFlow they were UIDs (not sequence numbers), causing iCloud to reject the FETCH command
- `collectUidsViaFetch()` also switched from async iterators to `fetchAll()` for reliable error handling
- Search and fetch fallback chain hardened — any failure at any level is caught and falls through gracefully

## [1.2.7] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- iCloud Junk/Trash folder search rewritten — `fetchAll()` replaces async iterators (`for await`) so IMAP errors are properly catchable instead of being lost in the stream
- Any SEARCH failure now triggers FETCH fallback (no longer requires "Invalid message number" pattern match)
- Empty folder defaults changed from `-1` to `0` so `effectiveCount` correctly detects empty folders

## [1.2.6] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- Empty folder detection now handles unknown message counts — `effectiveCount <= 0` instead of `=== 0` prevents search attempts when both `STATUS` and `mailbox.exists` return unknown (-1), which caused "Invalid message number" errors on empty iCloud folders

## [1.2.5] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- `email-mcp-setup` bin now includes shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env node`) and executable permissions — previously failed when invoked via `npx email-mcp-setup`

## [1.2.4] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- iCloud Junk folder search no longer fails with "Invalid message number" — uses `STATUS` command to get real message count when `mailbox.exists` reports 0 (iCloud server bug)
- SEARCH fallback now triggers on "Invalid message number" even when text-based search criteria are present (previously only triggered with no criteria)
- Multi-level FETCH fallback chain: `FETCH 1:*` → explicit range `FETCH 1:N` → individual sequence fetches (most resilient against iCloud quirks)

### Added
- `client.noop()` before search to refresh stale IMAP connection state
- `client.status()` pre-check to detect real message count independently of SELECT
- Comprehensive iCloud Junk folder fallback tests (6 new test cases)

## [1.2.3] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- IMAP/iCloud `deleteEmail()` and `batchDelete()` no longer hardcode `'Trash'` as move destination — now uses `resolveFolder('Trash')` to find the provider-specific trash folder (e.g., iCloud's "Deleted Messages")
- Deleting emails already in the trash folder now uses permanent delete instead of attempting to move trash→trash
- `sourceFolder` parameter in delete operations is now resolved through `resolveFolder()`, so passing "Trash" on iCloud correctly opens "Deleted Messages"

## [1.2.2] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- Outlook OAuth tokens now refresh automatically mid-session — `getProvider()` detects expired tokens and reconnects instead of failing with "JWT is not well formed"
- Token refresh errors now propagate instead of being silently swallowed, giving clear error messages when re-authentication is needed
- Invalid Date handling in token expiry check — `new Date('')` no longer bypasses the refresh logic

### Added
- Mid-session token expiry detection in `AccountManager.getProvider()` — automatically disconnects and reconnects when OAuth token expires
- Access token validation after refresh — empty tokens from MSAL are rejected with actionable error messages

## [1.2.1] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- iCloud IMAP search no longer fails with "Invalid message number" — falls back to direct FETCH when UID SEARCH is rejected
- Outlook "Id is malformed" errors on older messages — Graph API now uses immutable IDs (`Prefer: IdType="ImmutableId"`) that survive folder moves

### Added
- `collectUidsViaFetch()` fallback for IMAP servers that reject UID SEARCH ALL (e.g. iCloud)
- `fetchEmails()` extracted method for reusable UID-based email fetching
- Early return when IMAP mailbox reports zero messages (avoids unnecessary SEARCH on empty folders)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- Outlook OAuth token renewal now works automatically — tokens no longer expire and require manual re-authentication
- IMAP search errors now surface actionable server messages instead of opaque "Command failed"

### Changed
- Outlook auth uses MSAL file-based cache persistence (`~/.email-mcp/msal-cache.json`) for refresh token survival across process restarts
- Token refresh uses `acquireTokenSilent()` instead of broken `acquireTokenByRefreshToken('')` approach
- `refreshTokenIfNeeded()` now logs refresh failures instead of silently swallowing them

### Added
- `OutlookAuth.refreshTokenSilent()` method using MSAL's persisted cache and `acquireTokenSilent()`
- `msal_home_account_id` field on `OAuthTokens` for identifying the cached MSAL account
- File-based `ICachePlugin` implementation for MSAL token cache persistence

## [1.1.2] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed
- IMAP folder search errors now surface actual server response instead of opaque "Command failed"
- Search on iCloud Junk folder no longer fails silently — added folder resolution that matches by path, name, special-use flag, or common aliases
- ImapFlow `search()` returning `false` on server rejection no longer crashes with TypeError on `.slice()`

### Added
- `formatImapError()` helper that extracts `responseText`, `serverResponseCode`, and `mailboxMissing` from ImapFlow errors
- `resolveFolder()` method that resolves folder names against the server's folder list, handling provider-specific naming (e.g., iCloud "Deleted Messages" vs "Trash")
- Outlook batch requests now use sequential numeric IDs to avoid case-insensitive collision on message IDs
- Outlook API endpoints now URL-encode message IDs and folder paths

## [1.1.1] - 2026-02-19

### Changed
- Reverted build-time credential injection — OAuth PKCE credentials are now directly in source (industry standard for public CLI clients)
- Removed `.env.example` (no longer needed)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- Built-in OAuth credentials for Gmail and Outlook (PKCE) — users no longer need to create their own OAuth apps
- Zero-config setup for Gmail and Outlook via the interactive wizard

### Fixed
- Gmail PKCE flow now correctly passes `codeVerifier` to token exchange
- OAuth callback server accepts both `/callback` and `/` paths (fixes Outlook redirect)
- Build now produces correct shebangs (CLI entry only) and sets executable permissions
- Token refresh uses real OAuth credentials instead of empty strings

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed
- Added `mcpName` field to package.json for MCP Registry validation

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- Multi-provider email support: Gmail (REST API), Outlook (Microsoft Graph), iCloud (IMAP), generic IMAP/SMTP
- 24 MCP tools across 5 categories: account management, reading, sending, organization, batch operations
- Batch operations: `email_batch_delete`, `email_batch_move`, `email_batch_mark` with provider-native implementations
- Lightweight search mode (`returnBody=false` by default) reducing payload from ~1.4MB to ~20KB
- `sourceFolder` parameter for IMAP/iCloud move, delete, and mark operations
- Outlook folder resolution with localized display name support (English, German, Spanish, French)
- Interactive setup wizard with multi-account support ("add another?" loop)
- OAuth2 browser-based flows for Gmail and Outlook
- AES-256-GCM encrypted credential storage
- Sequential fallback for batch operations on providers without native batch support
