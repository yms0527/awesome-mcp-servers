**Send real postcards from code.** MCP server for [Postcard.bot](https://postcard.bot) — let AI agents send physical postcards worldwide.

Works with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and any MCP-compatible client.

## Hosted Server (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started — no API key needed, no local install. Just add the URL and sign in with your Postcard.bot account:

```
https://postcard.bot/api/mcp
```

**Claude Desktop** (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "postcardbot": {
      "url": "https://postcard.bot/api/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Code:**

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http postcardbot https://postcard.bot/api/mcp
```

Your MCP client will open a browser for you to sign in with Google or email. Click "Allow" and you're ready to send postcards.

---

## Local Server (npm)

If you prefer running the server locally with an API key:

### 1. Get an API key

Sign up at [postcard.bot](https://postcard.bot), go to your [account page](https://postcard.bot/account), and generate an API key.

### 2. Add balance

Add credits at [postcard.bot/buy-credits](https://postcard.bot/buy-credits) or via the API. Prepaid balance — volume pricing from $0.69/postcard.

### 3. Configure your MCP client

**Claude Desktop** (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "postcardbot": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@postcardbot/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "POSTCARDBOT_API_KEY": "pk_live_your_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Code:**

```bash
claude mcp add postcardbot -- npx -y @postcardbot/mcp-server
```

Then set the environment variable `POSTCARDBOT_API_KEY` in your shell.

**Cursor / Windsurf** — add the same JSON config to your MCP settings.

## Tools

### `send_postcard`

Send a physical postcard. Cards are printed and shipped within 24 hours. Delivery takes 5-10 business days.

**Parameters:**
- `to` — Recipient address (`name`, `address_line1`, `city` required; `address_line2`, `state`, `zip`, `country` optional)
- `from` — Sender/return address (same fields)
- `message` — Back-of-card message (max 350 characters)
- `image_url` — Front image URL (publicly accessible, min 1875x1275px recommended)

**Example prompt:**

### `bulk_send`

Send the same postcard to multiple recipients (async). Up to 5,000 recipients per request. Cards are processed in background batches.

**Parameters:**
- `recipients` — Array of recipient addresses (max 5,000, same fields as `to` above)
- `from` — Sender/return address (same for all postcards)
- `message` — Back-of-card message (max 350 characters)
- `image_url` — Front image URL (publicly accessible, min 1875x1275px recommended)

Total cost is reserved upfront. Failed cards are automatically refunded.

**Parameters:**

- `events` — Event types: `postcard.created`, `postcard.sent`, `postcard.delivered`, `postcard.failed`, `postcard.returned`

The signing secret is returned only once — save it securely. Events are signed with HMAC-SHA256 in the `X-PostcardBot-Signature` header.

### `delete_webhook`
