## [0.1.7] - Unreleased

### Added

- **Strategy 0 (disk read) for `get_email()`** — reads email content directly from `.emlx` files on disk, bypassing JXA/Apple Events entirely. Fastest path when the search index is available. Falls through to JXA strategies on failure. (Thanks to @vkostakos for the initial implementation in PR #53)
- Extracts read/flagged status from `.emlx` plist footer flags bitmask
- Extracts `date_sent`, `reply_to`, `Message-ID` from MIME headers for full schema parity
- `get_email` benchmark scenario with dynamic message ID discovery
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` for new contributors
- This changelog

### Fixed

- `date_received` now uses the `Received` header (delivery time) instead of `Date` header (composition time). Previously both `date_received` and `date_sent` were identical. Run `apple-mail-mcp rebuild` after upgrading to fix historical emails.

### Changed

- Updated project messaging across all descriptions to reflect disk-first architecture
- Re-ran competitive benchmarks with new `get_email` scenario
- Updated all docs, descriptions, and online listings for v0.1.7

## [0.1.6] - 2026-03-08

### Changed

- Hardened benchmark harness with error detection, probe screening, and crash guards
- Updated documentation and charts with corrected benchmark results
- Bumped `server.json` to 0.1.6

## [0.1.5] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- External attachment support (reads from `.mbox` sibling directories)
- Scan hardening for corrupt/oversized `.emlx` files
- Mailbox cap documentation and warnings

### Fixed

- Guard external attachment reads against oversized files
- Path traversal guard for attachment extraction

## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- `.partial.emlx` file indexing
- Public API exports
- Attachment fidelity in parsed results
- Scan resilience for edge cases

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- Attachment support with FTS5 sanitizer rewrite
- 3-strategy `get_email()` cascade (specified mailbox, index lookup, iterate all)
- Schema v4 with `attachments` table

### Fixed

- Strategy 2 over-scoping by defaults
- Race-safe mtime sort
- FK pragma, `message_id` scoping, `exclude_mailboxes`

## [0.1.2] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- MCP Registry manifest (`server.json`)

### Fixed

- FTS5 search now respects account/mailbox filters (#4)
- FTS5 mailbox filter regression
- Async lock to prevent concurrent `ensure_loaded()` races

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- Documentation site (GitHub Pages)
- Competitive benchmarking suite against 7 Apple Mail MCP servers

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- Initial release
- Fast MCP server for Apple Mail with batch JXA (87x faster than naive iteration)
- FTS5 search index (700-3500x faster body search)
- 6 MCP tools: `list_accounts`, `list_mailboxes`, `get_emails`, `get_email`, `search`, `get_attachment`
- Disk-based sync for index building
- Real-time file watcher for index updates
