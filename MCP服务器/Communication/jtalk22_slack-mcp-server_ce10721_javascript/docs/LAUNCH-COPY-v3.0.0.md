# Launch Copy (v3.0.0)

Canonical text blocks for GitHub release surfaces, listings, and operator updates.

## Short Summary (Public)

`@jtalk22/slack-mcp v3.0.0` is live. `v3.0.0` flips hosted `/mcp` from permissive to secure-default without breaking local workflows. Local-first operation stays unchanged (`stdio`, `web`) while hosted HTTP now requires bearer authentication (`SLACK_MCP_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN`) and explicit origin allowlisting (`SLACK_MCP_HTTP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`). The major version reflects this hosted behavior shift; MCP tool names remain stable. Diagnostics remain deterministic (`--doctor` returns `0|1|2|3`), and `--status` remains read-only. Public demo/media checks are now included in web verification so broken assets are caught before publish. Maintainer/operator: `jtalk22` (`support@revasserlabs.com`).

## GitHub Release Block

````md
`v3.0.0` flips hosted `/mcp` from permissive to secure-default without breaking local workflows.

```bash
npx -y @jtalk22/slack-mcp@latest --version
npx -y @jtalk22/slack-mcp@latest --doctor
npx -y @jtalk22/slack-mcp@latest --status
```

What changed:
- `/mcp` requires bearer auth by default
- CORS is origin-allowlist driven (`SLACK_MCP_HTTP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`)
- no MCP tool renames/removals
- deterministic diagnostics are preserved
