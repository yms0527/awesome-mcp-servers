# Deployment Modes

Use this guide to choose the right operating mode before rollout.

## Quick Chooser

- Choose **Cloud** if you want the managed deployment path with an API key and hosted endpoint.
- Choose `stdio` for personal self-hosted use in Claude Desktop/Claude Code.
- Choose local `web` for browser workflows and manual Slack browsing.
- Choose hosted HTTP only when you need remote execution and can handle token operations.
- Choose Smithery/Worker only when your consumers require registry-hosted MCP transport.

## Mode Matrix

| Mode | Start Command | Best For | Auth Material | Exposure | Notes |
|------|---------------|----------|---------------|----------|-------|
| **Cloud** | N/A — managed | Teams using the hosted deployment path | API key from checkout | `mcp.revasserlabs.com` | $19/mo Solo, $49/mo Team. 15 standard managed tools + 3 AI workflows on Team. Local Docker/token handling not required. |
| Local MCP (`stdio`) | `npx -y @jtalk22/slack-mcp` | Individual daily usage in Claude | `SLACK_TOKEN` + `SLACK_COOKIE` via token file/env | Local process | Lowest ops burden. Free. 16 tools. |
| Local Web UI (`web`) | `npx -y @jtalk22/slack-mcp web` | Browser-first usage, manual search/send | Same as above + generated API key | `localhost` by default | Useful when MCP is not available |
| Hosted MCP (`http`) | `node src/server-http.js` | Controlled hosted integration | Env-injected Slack token/cookie + HTTP bearer token | Remote endpoint | `/mcp` is bearer-protected by default; configure CORS allowlist |
| Smithery/Worker | `wrangler deploy` + Smithery publish flow | Registry distribution for hosted consumers | Query/env token handoff | Remote endpoint | Keep worker version parity with npm release |

## Cloud Deployment

Managed deployment path:

1. Purchase a plan at [Slack MCP Cloud](https://mcp.revasserlabs.com)
2. Receive API key and config snippets on the success page
3. Paste config into Claude Desktop or Claude Code
4. All 15 standard managed tools are available immediately (plus 3 AI workflows on Team plan)

Cloud handles hosted credential storage, encryption (AES-256-GCM), and rate limiting.

## Team Deployment Guidance

If you are deploying for more than one operator:

1. Start with one maintainer on local `stdio`.
2. Document token lifecycle and rotation ownership.
3. Define support window and incident contact before enabling hosted mode.
4. Validate `/health` and MCP initialize responses on every release.

## Release Checklist by Mode

### Local `stdio`

1. `npx -y @jtalk22/slack-mcp --status`
2. `npx -y @jtalk22/slack-mcp --help`
3. Confirm tool list in Claude client.

### Local `web`

1. `npx -y @jtalk22/slack-mcp web`
2. Verify API key generation at `~/.slack-mcp-api-key`.
3. Verify `/health`, `/conversations`, and `/search` endpoints.

### Hosted (`http` or Worker)

1. Verify `version` parity across `package.json`, server metadata, and health responses.
2. Verify HTTP auth behavior:
   - missing `SLACK_MCP_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN` returns `503`
   - bad bearer token returns `401`
   - valid bearer token succeeds
3. Verify CORS behavior:
   - denied by default
   - allowed origins work when listed in `SLACK_MCP_HTTP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
4. Confirm `slack_get_thread`, `slack_search_messages`, and `slack_users_info` behavior.
5. Confirm token handling mode (ephemeral vs env persistence) is documented.
