# @multimail/mcp-server

MCP server for [MultiMail](https://multimail.dev). Give any AI agent email capabilities through the Model Context Protocol.

## Quick start

```bash
npx @multimail/mcp-server
```

Requires `MULTIMAIL_API_KEY` environment variable. Get one at [multimail.dev](https://multimail.dev).

By using MultiMail you agree to the [Terms of Service](https://multimail.dev/terms) and [Acceptable Use Policy](https://multimail.dev/acceptable-use).

## Setup

### Option A: Remote server (recommended)

No install required. Connect directly to our hosted server. Authenticates via OAuth in the browser.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "multimail": {
      "type": "url",
      "url": "https://mcp.multimail.dev/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Works with Claude.ai, Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and any client that supports remote MCP servers.

### Option B: Local server (stdio)

Run the server locally. API key is passed as an environment variable.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "multimail": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@multimail/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "MULTIMAIL_API_KEY": "mm_live_...",
        "MULTIMAIL_MAILBOX_ID": "01KJ1NHN8J..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Where to add this

| Client | Config file |
|--------|------------|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/.mcp.json` |
| Claude Desktop | `claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project |
| Windsurf | `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` |
| Copilot (VS Code) | `.vscode/mcp.json` in your project |
| OpenCode | `mcp.json` in your project |
| ChatGPT Desktop | Settings > MCP Servers |

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `MULTIMAIL_API_KEY` | Yes | Your MultiMail API key (`mm_live_...`) |
| `MULTIMAIL_MAILBOX_ID` | No | Default mailbox ID. If not set, pass `mailbox_id` to each tool or call `list_mailboxes` first. |
| `MULTIMAIL_API_URL` | No | API base URL. Defaults to `https://api.multimail.dev`. |

## First-run setup

On first use, MultiMail will prompt you to configure your mailbox. You can also run this explicitly using the `configure_mailbox` tool:

- **Oversight mode**: How much human approval is required (`gated_send`, `monitored`, `autonomous`, etc.)
- **Display name**: Sender name shown in emails
- **CC/BCC defaults**: Automatically copy addresses on all outbound emails
- **Scheduling**: Enable/disable scheduled send and set default gate timing
- **Signature**: Email signature block

If you skip this step, MultiMail will remind you on your first tool call.

## How it works

- You write email bodies in **markdown**. MultiMail converts to formatted HTML for delivery.
- Incoming email arrives as **clean markdown**. No HTML parsing or MIME decoding.
- Threading is automatic. Reply to an email and headers are set correctly.
- Sends return `pending_scan` status while the email is scanned for threats. If your mailbox uses gated oversight, the status transitions to `pending_send_approval` for human review. Do not retry or resend.
- Verify other agents by checking the `X-MultiMail-Identity` signed header on received emails.

## Development
