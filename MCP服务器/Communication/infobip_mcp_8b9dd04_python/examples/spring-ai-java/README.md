# Infobip MCP Spring AI Demo

This demo application showcases the integration of Infobip's MCP Server with [Spring AI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/index.html) to build a conversational AI agent. The application demonstrates the capabilities of the Infobip SMS MCP server and can be easily adapted to work with other Infobip MCP servers.

## Setup and Installation (Linux/MacOS)

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
./mvnw clean install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file based on the provided `.env.example` and configure the following required environment variables:

- `AWS_REGION` - AWS region to use (e.g., `us-east-1`)
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` - Your AWS access key
- `AWS_SECRET_KEY` - Your AWS secret key
- `AWS_MODEL_ID` - The model ID to use. You can use the [Supported models and model features](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/conversation-inference-supported-models-features.html)
- `INFOBIP_API_KEY` - Your Infobip [API key](https://www.infobip.com/docs/essentials/api-essentials/api-authentication#api-key-header) (see [Scopes](#scopes) section below for details)

### 3. Run the application

```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a; ./mvnw --quiet spring-boot:run
```

## Scopes

To successfully run the demo, you need the correct [scopes](https://www.infobip.com/docs/essentials/api-essentials/api-authorization#api-scopes) assigned to your Infobip API key.

To use the Infobip SMS MCP server to its full capacity, ensure you have the `sms:manage` scope assigned.

The scopes for a particular MCP server can be found under `scopes_supported` in the authorization server metadata at:

```
{mcp-server-url}/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
```

For example, the scopes for the Infobip SMS MCP server are available at:
https://mcp.infobip.com/sms/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server

## Usage

### Interacting with the Agent

You can interact with the agent through the command line interface (CLI).

Enjoy the conversation!
