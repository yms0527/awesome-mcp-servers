# Enhanced Commands Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the enhanced command system for the Telegram bot, which now supports both raw and AI-enhanced output modes.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Configuration Management

- Created `HermesConfigManager` class to persist user preferences
- Config stored in `/app/data/hermes-config.json` in Docker container
- Default mode is "enhanced" (`-e`) but can be changed

### 2. Command Flags

Users can now control output mode with flags:
- `-e` or `--enhance`: Force AI enhancement
- `-r` or `--raw`: Force raw output
- No flag: Uses default from config

### 3. Updated Commands

All `:h` commands now support the flag system:

```
:h ls [-e|-r]              # List files
:h cat <file> [-e|-r]      # Read file
:h write <file> <content>  # Write file (no enhancement)
:h append <file> <content> # Append to file (no enhancement)
:h edit <file> <line> <new># Edit file (no enhancement)
:h config                  # View current config
:h config default <-e|-r>  # Change default mode
:h help                    # Show updated help
```

### 4. Smart Enhancement

The system only enhances output when it makes sense:
- `ls` and `cat` commands with substantial output
- Never enhances action commands (write, append, edit)
- Skips enhancement for very short outputs

### 5. Enhanced Output Format

When enhanced mode is active:
1. Shows raw output first
2. Adds "🧠 AI Insights:" section
3. Provides context-aware explanations

Example:
```
📂 Files:
```
README.md
package.json
src/
```

🧠 AI Insights:
This appears to be a Node.js project with:
- README.md for documentation
- package.json for dependencies
- src/ directory containing source code
```

### 6. Deployment Notification

The bot now sends a message when redeployed:
> "🚀 I just redeployed and boy are my network packets fragmented! How are you doing?"

This helps users know when the bot has been updated.

## Architecture Changes

### Updated Files

1. **src/telegram-bot-ai-powered.ts**
   - Added `HermesConfigManager` integration
   - Rewrote `handleWorkspaceCommand` for flag parsing
   - Added `executeCommand`, `shouldEnhance`, and `sendEnhancedOutput` methods
   - Added deployment notification on startup

2. **src/utils/hermes-config.ts** (new)
   - Manages persistent configuration
   - Handles default flag preference

3. **docker/start-hermes-workspace.sh**
   - Creates `/app/data` directory for config storage

4. **docker-compose.hermes-workspace.yml**
   - Already includes `AUTHORIZED_CHAT_ID` for deployment notifications

## Usage Examples

### Check current default mode
```
:h config
```
Response: "Default mode: Enhanced 🧠"

### Change to raw mode by default
```
:h config default -r
```
Response: "✅ Default mode changed to: Raw 📝"

### Force enhanced mode for one command
```
:h ls -e
```
Shows file list with AI insights about the project structure

### Force raw mode for one command
```
:h cat package.json -r
```
Shows just the file content without AI analysis

## Benefits

1. **User Control**: Users can choose their preferred interaction style
2. **Performance**: Raw mode is faster when AI insights aren't needed
3. **Cost Savings**: Reduces API calls when using raw mode
4. **Flexibility**: Can switch modes on per-command basis
5. **Persistence**: Preferences survive bot restarts

## Future Enhancements

1. Per-command default preferences
2. User-specific preferences (different defaults for different users)
3. Streaming enhancement for large outputs
4. Custom enhancement templates
5. Command history with mode tracking
