**Basic Equality:**
• event_date:'2024-06-11'
• period:'30'
• selected_cids:'cid_1,cid_2,cid_3'

**Combined Conditions:**
• event_date:'2024-06-11'+period:'30'
• event_date:'2024-06-11'+selected_cids:'cid_1,cid_2'

**Date Comparisons:**
• event_date:>'2024-01-01'
• event_date:<='2024-06-11'

**Period Comparisons:**
• period:>='14'
• period:<='60'

=== 💡 SYNTAX RULES ===
• Use single quotes around values: 'value'
• Date format must be ISO 8601: 'YYYY-MM-DD'
• Combine conditions with + (AND) or , (OR)
• Use parentheses for grouping: (condition1,condition2)+condition3
