# GUARDRAIL: Security Framework for Large Language Model Applications

# Application Security Onion

![Application Security Onion Diagram](AppSecOnion.png)

## Overview

The Application Security Onion diagram visualizes the layered security concerns that modern applications face, with a particular focus on how newer LLM (Large Language Model) and Agent-based systems build upon traditional security foundations.

## Understanding the Layers

Like an onion, application security consists of multiple layers that must all be addressed for comprehensive protection:

### Layer 1: Traditional Web Security (Outer Layer)
The foundation of all application security, covering fundamental concerns like authentication, authorization, input validation, and transport security. These are well-established practices that remain essential regardless of application type.

### Layer 2: Data & Infrastructure Security
Building on basic web security, this layer addresses how data is stored, processed, and transported across infrastructure components. This includes database security, container protection, network segmentation, and dependency management.

### Layer 3: LLM Application Security
Specific security concerns for applications that leverage large language models. This newer domain includes protections against prompt injection, jailbreaking attempts, output sanitization, and preventing data leakage through model interactions.

### Layer 4: Agent & MCP Security (Core)
At the center are emerging security concerns specific to autonomous agents and the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This includes message classification, context verification, trust scoring, and flow control between agent components.

## Applications

The Application Security Onion can be used to:

- Assess security coverage across different domains
- Identify gaps in security planning
- Prioritize security initiatives based on foundational requirements
- Educate teams on the relationship between traditional and emerging security concerns
- Create security checklists that ensure all layers are addressed

## Implementation Guidance

When approaching application security, work from the outside in:

1. Ensure traditional web security controls are robust and well-implemented
2. Address data and infrastructure security concerns
3. Implement LLM-specific protections as needed
4. Apply agent and MCP-specific security controls at the core

Remember that inner layers depend on outer layers - LLM application security measures will be undermined if traditional web security elements like authentication are weak.

## Contributing

This model is evolving as security practices for LLM applications and agents mature. Contributions and suggestions for improving the Application Security Onion are welcome.

# Practical Security vs. Framework Complexity: The GUARDRAIL Reality Check

## 1. Isolation vs. Framework Complexity

Simple containerization or VM isolation often provides more immediate security benefits than complex frameworks. While GUARDRAIL offers sophisticated protocol-level security, basic isolation through Docker or VMs:

- Creates clear security boundaries
- Limits potential damage from compromises
- Requires minimal specialized knowledge to implement
- Provides proven protection with lower implementation risk

**Reality check**: For many teams, proper containerization with resource limits and minimal attack surface would deliver more immediate security value than implementing GUARDRAIL's multi-layered architecture.

## 2. The Credential Security Gap

The absence of clear credential security patterns in GUARDRAIL is a significant oversight. Basic credential security practices like:

- Secrets management (using tools like HashiCorp Vault or cloud key management)
- Environment variable segregation
- Credential rotation
- Least-privilege access patterns

...aren't explicitly addressed in the framework, despite being fundamental to application security.

**Reality check**: Storing API keys securely is more immediately valuable than implementing sophisticated protocol-level security annotations.

## 3. HTTP/SSE Implementation Mismatch

GUARDRAIL's protocol-agnostic approach might seem attractive, but it creates a disconnect from the specific security concerns of HTTP and SSE implementations, including:

- CORS policies
- Content Security Policy
- HTTP header security
- Cross-site scripting protection
- HTTP-specific authentication patterns

**Reality check**: Framework abstractions that don't connect to your actual transport mechanism (HTTP/SSE) create implementation gaps.

## 4. The Authentication Blind Spot

Authentication is curiously underdeveloped in GUARDRAIL, which focuses more on attestation between services than user authentication. It lacks:

- Integration patterns with identity providers
- Token validation and management
- Session security
- Authorization frameworks

**Reality check**: Without solid authentication fundamentals, other security layers become much less effective.

## 5. The Developer Knowledge Problem

GUARDRAIL doesn't solve the problem of "young devs with no background in app level security." Complex frameworks can actually exacerbate this problem by:

- Creating a false sense of security ("we implemented GUARDRAIL so we're secure")
- Adding complexity that obscures basic security principles
- Requiring specialized knowledge to implement correctly
- Potentially introducing new security gaps through misconfiguration

**Reality check**: Developer security education and simple, consistent security patterns often yield better outcomes than complex frameworks.

## Practical Recommendations

Instead of full GUARDRAIL implementation, consider:

1. **Start with basics**: Proper isolation, credential management, input validation, and output sanitization

2. **Implement LLM-specific controls**: Add targeted protections against prompt injection, jailbreaking, and data leakage

3. **Use established auth patterns**: Leverage battle-tested authentication libraries and frameworks rather than building custom solutions

4. **Security education**: Invest in developer security awareness specific to LLM applications

5. **Selective adoption**: If some GUARDRAIL concepts seem valuable (like the Information Gateway Layer), implement them pragmatically without the full framework complexity

## Conclusion

GUARDRAIL offers an academically interesting approach to LLM security but may overcomplicate what are often straightforward security challenges. Sometimes basic isolation, handling credentials properly, and following established HTTP security practices will deliver more real security value than implementing complex architectural frameworks.

The gap between security theory and practice remains wide, and addressing fundamental developer security knowledge will likely yield better outcomes than adding architectural complexity through comprehensive frameworks like GUARDRAIL.

## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming various industries, but their power and complexity introduce significant security risks. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) aims to standardize communication between LLM applications and services. GUARDRAIL addresses the inherent security challenges by providing a comprehensive and *incrementally adoptable* security framework specifically tailored for MCP and other LLM application ecosystems.  It is designed to be practical and easy to integrate, starting with simple enhancements and progressing to more advanced security measures.

## 2. Core Principles <a name="core-principles"></a>

GUARDRAIL is built on the following core principles:

1.  **Information Flow Control:** Strict policies govern the movement of information, preventing unauthorized data exfiltration and infiltration. This includes data classification and fine-grained control over data access.
2.  **Contextual Security:** Security decisions are made based on the *dynamic* execution context, including continuous trust assessment.
3.  **Transport-Agnostic Protection:** Security guarantees are provided *regardless* of the underlying transport mechanism.
4.  **Least-Privilege Execution:** All components operate with the *minimum* necessary permissions, granted just-in-time and revoked when no longer needed.
5. **Zero Trust:** No component or user is inherently trusted. Continuous verification is required.

## 3. Architecture Overview <a name="architecture-overview"></a>

### 3.1 Security Layers <a name="security-layers"></a>

GUARDRAIL implements a multi-layered architecture, with each layer providing distinct security controls.  These layers can be implemented *incrementally*, starting with the most critical.

        MC[MCP Client]
    end

    subgraph "GUARDRAIL"
        direction TB

    end

    MC -- "MCP Protocol" --> IGL
    ECL -- "Contained Execution" --> MS
```

*   **Information Gateway Layer (IGL):**  Manages information flows, content classification, flow policy enforcement, and transport security. *This is a primary focus for initial implementations.*
*   **Context Verification Layer (CVL):** Establishes trust through attestation and client/server verification. *Can be added after the IGL is established.*
*   **Request Control Layer (RCL):** Implements fine-grained access control, request filtering, and action limiting. *Adds another layer of defense on top of context verification.*
*   **Execution Containment Layer (ECL):** Ensures code execution within secure, isolated boundaries (e.g., using containers or sandboxes). *This is for more advanced deployments with higher security needs.*
*   **Audit and Monitoring Layer (AML):** Provides visibility into system operations and security events.  *Essential for monitoring and incident response.*

### 3.2 Deployment Models <a name="deployment-models"></a>

GUARDRAIL can be deployed in several configurations:

1.  **Embedded Model:** GUARDRAIL components are integrated directly into the host process (both client and server). This is suitable for standalone applications or development/testing environments.

2.  **Gateway Model:** GUARDRAIL operates as a standalone security gateway, mediating *all* MCP traffic. This is ideal for enterprise deployments with strict security requirements.

3.  **Service Mesh Model:** GUARDRAIL components are deployed as sidecars within a Kubernetes environment (or similar). This is best suited for cloud-native and microservices architectures.

GUARDRAIL is designed for seamless integration with MCP. It provides wrapper classes for MCP Clients and Servers and can also hook in at a lower level, using the ESM.

```typescript
// Client Integration Example
import { Client } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client";
import { GuardrailClient } from "@guardrail/sdk/client";

// Initialize standard MCP client
const mcpClient = new Client({
  name: "example-client",
  version: "1.0.0"
});

// Wrap with Guardrail protection (Basic)
const client = new GuardrailClient(mcpClient, {
  security: {
    classification_level: "INTERNAL", // Start with basic classification
    // Add more options later as needed.
  }
});

// Normal MCP operations now protected by Guardrail
await client.connect(transport);
```

## 6. Practical Security Innovations <a name="practical-security-innovations"></a>

GUARDRAIL incorporates key innovations designed for *practical implementation and incremental adoption*. These are the building blocks of a secure MCP ecosystem.

### 6.1 Extensible Security Middleware (ESM) <a name="extensible-security-middleware-esm"></a>

## 8. Detailed Documentation <a name="detailed-documentation"></a>

While this README serves as the primary, definitive source for understanding the GUARDRAIL framework, several supplementary documents exist that capture various stages of brainstorming, design iterations, and more detailed technical explorations. These documents should be considered *supporting material* and may contain ideas that are still under development, have been superseded, or represent alternative approaches. However, they can be valuable for understanding the evolution of the design and for exploring specific aspects in greater depth.

**Important Note:** The documents referenced below represent different points in the GUARDRAIL design process. This README reflects the *current, prioritized, and more practical approach*. If discrepancies exist between the README and these supplementary documents, the README should be considered the authoritative source.

Here's a guide to the supplementary documents:

*   [**Technical Specification (2-technical-spec.md)**](./2-technical-spec.md): This document is the most comprehensive technical deep-dive, representing an *early, expansive vision* of GUARDRAIL. It includes detailed specifications for all layers, components, configurations, and algorithms. While the core principles remain valid, the implementation details and overall architecture have been streamlined in this README (especially in Section 6). Use this for:
    *   **Detailed Component Requirements:** Granular specifications for each layer.
    *   **Configuration Schemas:** JSON schemas for all configurable aspects.
    *   **Algorithm Descriptions:** In-depth explanations of core algorithms.
    *   **Threat Model:** A detailed threat model and countermeasures.
    *   **Conformance Levels:** Definitions of different conformance levels.

*   [**Architecture Diagrams (6-diags-mermaid.md)**](./6-diags-mermaid.md): A collection of Mermaid diagrams visualizing various aspects of GUARDRAIL, including some earlier, more complex design ideas. Use this for:
    *   **Alternative Workflow Diagrams:** Different perspectives on core workflows.
    *   **Detailed Component Interactions:** Granular views of internal component relationships.
    *   **Deployment Model Variations:** More detailed diagrams of deployment options.
    *   **Emergency Response Flows:** Visualizations of emergency response procedures.
    *   **Exploration of Earlier Concepts:** Diagrams of earlier design iterations.

*   [**Initial GUARDRAIL Proposal (1-GUARDRAIL-mcp-security-claude.md)**](./1-GUARDRAIL-mcp-security-claude.md): This document represents an *initial proposal* for the GUARDRAIL framework, generated by Claude. It provides a good overview of the initial problem statement and proposed solution, but it predates the refinements and practical considerations outlined in this README.  It's useful for understanding the *original motivation and conceptual basis* for GUARDRAIL.

*    **[Emergency Response Framework](./SHIELD-7-emergency-response-framework.md)**. This doc details the emergency response plan, a key compoennt of the overall security strategy. Note that this doc still uses the SHIELD naming convention, which is a historical artifact.

*   **Synthesis and Innovation Documents (various `*-synthesis-*.md` files):** These documents (e.g., `7-synthesis-gemini.md`, `9-new-innovations-diags-claude.md`, `10-new-innovations-claude.md`) represent *intermediate brainstorming and synthesis steps*. They explore various new innovations and enhancements to GUARDRAIL, combining ideas from different sources and iterating on the design. These are useful for understanding the *thought process* behind the "Practical Security Innovations" presented in Section 6 of this README.  However, the final, refined versions of these innovations are described in *this* README.

*   **Critical Analysis Documents (15-CRITICAL-ANALYSIS-claude-and-gemini.md):** This document provides a *critical review* of the GUARDRAIL framework and explores alternative approaches to securing MCP. It highlights the strengths and weaknesses of GUARDRAIL and discusses the trade-offs of different design choices. This is valuable for understanding the *rationale* behind the move towards a more practical, incremental approach.

*   **Diagram Source Files (various `SVG-*.svg.txt` files):** These files contain the source code (in SVG format) for the diagrams included in this README and in `6-diags-mermaid.md`. They are primarily useful for developers who want to modify or extend the diagrams.

*   **Mermaid Diagram Source Files (various `SHIELD-*.md` files):** These files represent the *original* SHIELD-related Mermaid diagram source, from a prior, related project. These predate the extracted and refactored diagrams in `6-diags-mermaid.md` and `README.md`, and should generally be considered historical artifacts.

This collection of documents provides a comprehensive view of the GUARDRAIL project, from its initial conception to its current, refined state.  By understanding the evolution of the design and the rationale behind different choices, developers and stakeholders can gain a deeper appreciation for the framework and its capabilities. Remember to always prioritize the information in this README as the definitive source.





## 9. Emergency Response Framework <a name="emergency-response-framework"></a>

GUARDRAIL incorporates an Emergency Response Framework providing comprehensive procedures to detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents.  See [Emergency Response Framework](./SHIELD-7-emergency-response-framework.md) for details.

## 11. Phase 1 Implementation: Foundation (0-3 Months)  <a name="phase-1-implementation"></a>

### 11.1 Executive Summary <a name="phase-1-executive-summary"></a>

Phase 1 of GUARDRAIL focuses on establishing a baseline level of security within the Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem with minimal disruption to existing implementations. This phase prioritizes *incremental adoption* and delivers *immediate* security benefits. The core components implemented in Phase 1 are:

1.  **Protocol-Level Security Annotations:**  Adding optional metadata to MCP messages for classification, integrity, source identification, and replay protection.
2.  **Dynamic Security Context (DSC):**  Creating a shared, mutable context for tracking security-relevant information throughout an MCP connection.
3.  **Extensible Security Middleware (ESM) (Partial):**  Implementing the basic ESM framework with a limited set of *core* modules for validation, classification, integrity checking, sequence checking, and trust score updates.

This phase lays the groundwork for all subsequent security layers and allows early adopters to begin securing their MCP implementations.

### 11.2 Objectives <a name="phase-1-objectives"></a>

The measurable objectives of Phase 1 are:

1.  **Implement Mandatory Security Annotations:** Ensure all MCP messages include the `security` field with `classification`, `integrity`, `source`, and `sequence` attributes.
2.  **Establish Baseline Trust Score:** Implement a basic trust score mechanism within the DSC, with at least five distinct events that modify the trust score.
3.  **Reduce Replay Attacks:**  Decrease successful replay attacks by 99% (measured by comparing the number of detected replay attempts before and after Phase 1 implementation).
4.  **Validate Message Integrity:** Achieve 100% validation of message integrity for messages with the `security` field.
5. **Minimal Performance Overhead:** Limit the added latency due to security processing to no more than 5% for typical MCP messages.

### 11.3 Protocol-Level Security Annotations (Implementation Details) <a name="protocol-annotations-implementation"></a>

#### 11.3.1 JSON Schema <a name="protocol-annotations-json-schema"></a>

The following JSON schema defines the structure of the `security` field within MCP messages:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "classification": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["PUBLIC", "INTERNAL", "SENSITIVE", "RESTRICTED"]
    },
    "integrity": {
      "type": "string",
      "pattern": "^sha256:[a-f0-9]{64}$"
    },
    "source": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "sequence": {
      "type": "integer",
      "minimum": 0
    },
    "transformations": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "string"
      }
    }
  },
  "required": ["classification", "integrity", "source", "sequence"]
}
```

#### 11.3.2 Code Examples (TypeScript/Python) <a name="protocol-annotations-code-examples"></a>

**TypeScript - Adding the `security` field to a request:**

```typescript
import { createHmac } from 'crypto';

function addSecurityField(message: any, classification: string, source: string, sequence: number, sharedSecret: Buffer): any {
  const messageCopy = { ...message }; // Avoid modifying the original object
    delete messageCopy.security;

  const hmac = createHmac('sha256', sharedSecret);
    hmac.update(JSON.stringify(messageCopy));

    message.security = {
        classification: classification,
        integrity: 'sha256:' + hmac.digest('hex'),
        source: source,
        sequence: sequence,
        transformations: [] // Initialize transformations as empty
    };
    return message;
}
```

**Python - Adding the `security` field to a request:**

```python
import hashlib
import hmac
import json

def add_security_field(message, classification, source, sequence, shared_secret):
    message_copy = message.copy() # Avoid modifying the original
    if "security" in message_copy:
        del message_copy["security"]
    
    message_string = json.dumps(message_copy, sort_keys=True).encode('utf-8') # Consistent encoding
    integrity_hash = hmac.new(shared_secret, message_string, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
    message['security'] = {
        'classification': classification,
        'integrity': 'sha256:' + integrity_hash,
        'source': source,
        'sequence': sequence,
        'transformations': []  # Initialize transformations as empty
    }
    return message
```

**TypeScript - Adding the `security` field to a response:**

(Same `addSecurityField` function as above can be used for responses.)

**Python - Adding the `security` field to a response:**

(Same `add_security_field` function as above can be used for responses.)

**TypeScript - Validating the `security` field:**

```typescript
function validateSecurityField(message: any, sharedSecret: Buffer): boolean {
  if (!message.security) {
    return false;
  }

  const { classification, integrity, source, sequence } = message.security;

  if (!classification || !['PUBLIC', 'INTERNAL', 'SENSITIVE', 'RESTRICTED'].includes(classification)) {
    return false;
  }
  if (!integrity || !integrity.startsWith('sha256:')) {
    return false;
  }
  if (!source) {
    return false;
  }
  if (typeof sequence !== 'number' || sequence < 0) {
    return false;
  }
    //Verify integrity
    const messageCopy = { ...message };
    delete messageCopy.security;

    const hmac = createHmac('sha256', sharedSecret);
    hmac.update(JSON.stringify(messageCopy));
    const calculatedIntegrity = 'sha256:' + hmac.digest('hex');

    return integrity === calculatedIntegrity;
}
```

**Python - Validating the `security` field:**

```python
def validate_security_field(message, shared_secret):
    if not message.get('security'):
        return False

    security = message['security']
    classification = security.get('classification')
    integrity = security.get('integrity')
    source = security.get('source')
    sequence = security.get('sequence')

    if not classification or classification not in ['PUBLIC', 'INTERNAL', 'SENSITIVE', 'RESTRICTED']:
        return False
    if not integrity or not integrity.startswith('sha256:'):
        return False
    if not source:
        return False
    if not isinstance(sequence, int) or sequence < 0:
        return False
        
    #Verify integrity
    message_copy = message.copy()
    del message_copy["security"]
    message_string = json.dumps(message_copy, sort_keys=True).encode('utf-8')
    calculated_integrity = 'sha256:' + hmac.new(shared_secret, message_string, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()

    return integrity == calculated_integrity
```

**TypeScript - Handling Validation Errors:**

```typescript
// ... inside your message handling logic ...
if (!validateSecurityField(receivedMessage, sharedSecret)) {
  console.error("SEC001: Invalid security field."); // Standardized error code
  // Take appropriate action: reject the message, log the error, update DSC, etc.
}
```

**Python - Handling Validation Errors:**

```python
# ... inside your message handling logic ...
if not validate_security_field(received_message, shared_secret):
    print("SEC001: Invalid security field.")  # Standardized error code
    # Take appropriate action: reject the message, log the error, update DSC, etc.
```

#### 11.3.3 Classification Levels <a name="protocol-annotations-classification-levels"></a>

The following classification levels are defined for Phase 1:

*   **PUBLIC:**  Information that is safe for public disclosure. No restrictions on access or distribution.
*   **INTERNAL:** Information that is restricted to the organization and its authorized partners.
*   **SENSITIVE:** Information that requires additional protection due to privacy, legal, or regulatory requirements.
*   **RESTRICTED:** Highly sensitive information with strict access controls.  Disclosure could cause significant harm.

#### 11.3.4 Integrity Verification <a name="protocol-annotations-integrity-verification"></a>

The `integrity` field uses an HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) with SHA-256.  The HMAC is calculated using a *shared secret* derived during the `initialize` handshake (see [DSC Secure Initialization](#dsc-secure-initialization)).

**Formula:**

`integrity = "sha256:" + HMAC-SHA256(sharedSecret, message)`

Where `message` is the JSON string representation of the MCP message *excluding* the `security` field itself. The `sort_keys=True` is crucial for ensuring consistent results across different JSON implementations.

### 11.4 Dynamic Security Context (DSC) - Initial Implementation <a name="dsc-initial-implementation"></a>

#### 11.4.1 DSC Class Definition (TypeScript/Python) <a name="dsc-class-definition"></a>

**TypeScript:**

```typescript
class DynamicSecurityContext {
  private trustScore: number;
  private threatLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  private capabilities: Set<string>;
  private sessionData: Map<string, any>;
  private eventHistory: any[]; //  Replace 'any' with a proper event type
  private sharedSecret: Buffer;

  constructor(initialTrustScore: number, initialSharedSecret: Buffer) {
    this.trustScore = initialTrustScore;
    this.threatLevel = 'low';
    this.capabilities = new Set();
    this.sessionData = new Map();
    this.eventHistory = [];
    this.sharedSecret = initialSharedSecret;
  }

  getTrustScore(): number {
    return this.trustScore;
  }

  updateTrustScore(adjustment: number, reason: string): void {
    this.trustScore += adjustment;
    this.trustScore = Math.max(0, Math.min(100, this.trustScore)); // Clamp to 0-100

        // Update threat level based on trust score
    if (this.trustScore <= 25) {
      this.threatLevel = 'critical';
    } else if (this.trustScore <= 50) {
      this.threatLevel = 'high';
    } else if (this.trustScore <= 75) {
      this.threatLevel = 'medium';
    } else {
        this.threatLevel = 'low'
    }

    this.logEvent({ type: 'trust_score_update', adjustment, reason, timestamp: Date.now() });
  }

  getThreatLevel(): 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical' {
    return this.threatLevel;
  }
    
  getSharedSecret(): Buffer {
      return this.sharedSecret;
  }

  // ... other methods (addCapability, removeCapability, getSessionData, setSessionData, logEvent) ...

    logEvent(event: any): void {
      this.eventHistory.push(event)
    }
}

export { DynamicSecurityContext };
```

**Python:**

```python
class DynamicSecurityContext:
    def __init__(self, initial_trust_score, initial_shared_secret):
        self.trust_score = initial_trust_score
        self.threat_level = 'low'
        self.capabilities = set()
        self.session_data = {}
        self.event_history = []
        self.shared_secret = initial_shared_secret

    def get_trust_score(self):
        return self.trust_score

    def update_trust_score(self, adjustment, reason):
        self.trust_score += adjustment
        self.trust_score = max(0, min(100, self.trust_score))  # Clamp to 0-100

        # Update threat level based on trust score
        if self.trust_score <= 25:
            self.threat_level = 'critical'
        elif self.trust_score <= 50:
            self.threat_level = 'high'
        elif self.trust_score <= 75:

        else:
            self.threat_level = 'low'

        self.log_event({
            'type': 'trust_score_update',

        })

    def get_threat_level(self):
        return self.threat_level

    def get_shared_secret(self):
        return self.shared_secret
        
    # ... other methods (add_capability, remove_capability, get_session_data, set_session_data, log_event) ...
    def log_event(self, event):
        self.event_history.append(event)
```

#### 11.4.2 Trust Score Algorithm <a name="dsc-trust-score-algorithm"></a>

The trust score is a numerical value between 0 and 100, representing the trustworthiness of an MCP client or server.

**Algorithm:**

```
trustScore = initialTrustValue;
trustScore += event.trustImpact * weight; // trustImpact is +ve or -ve
trustScore = Math.max(0, Math.min(100, trustScore)); // Clamp to 0-100
```

**Example Events and Impacts:**

| Event                        | trustImpact | weight |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| Successful Authentication    | +5          | 1.0    |
| Invalid Signature           | -10         | 1.0    |
| Resource Quota Exceeded     | -2          | 0.5    |
| Valid Message Received       | +1          | 0.1    |
| Invalid Message Received    | -5          | 1.0    |
| Sequence Number Mismatch     | -8          | 1.0 |

**Threat Levels**
Threat levels will change according to these thresholds:

*   **low**: Between 76 and 100.
*   **medium**: Between 51 and 75.
*   **high**: Between 26 and 50.
*  **critical**: Between 0 and 25.

#### 11.4.3 Secure Initialization <a name="dsc-secure-initialization"></a>

Secure initialization of the DSC, including the exchange of a shared secret for integrity verification, is performed during the MCP `initialize` handshake.  This example uses a *simplified* Diffie-Hellman key exchange for demonstration purposes.  A *production implementation would use a more robust, well-vetted cryptographic library and protocol.*

import * as crypto from 'crypto';
const connectionContexts = new Map();

function handleInitializeRequest(request: any, transport: any) {
  // 1. Generate an ephemeral key pair.

        publicKeyEncoding: { type: 'spki', format: 'pem' },
        privateKeyEncoding: { type: 'pkcs8', format: 'pem' }
    });

  // 2. Create the initial DSC.

### 11.7 Testing Strategy <a name="phase-1-testing"></a>

Phase 1 testing will include:

*   **Unit Tests:**  Verify the correct behavior of individual classes and functions (DSC, ESM modules, helper functions).
*   **Integration Tests:**  Test the interaction between the ESM and the MCP client/server, ensuring messages are correctly processed and security annotations are handled.
*   **Security Tests:**
    *   **Replay Attack Simulation:**  Send duplicate messages with the same sequence number to verify replay protection.
    *   **Invalid Signature Injection:**  Send messages with modified content or incorrect integrity hashes to verify integrity checks.
    *   **Missing Security Field:** Send messages without the `security` field to verify that they are rejected (or handled appropriately based on configuration).
    *   **Invalid Classification:** Send messages with invalid classification values.
*  **Boundary condition tests:** Test with parameters at the limit of the specifications (very long strings, very big numbers, etc.)
*   **Performance Benchmarks:** Measure the added latency introduced by the security processing.

### 11.8 Resource Requirements <a name="phase-1-resources"></a>

### 11.9 Risk Mitigation <a name="phase-1-risks"></a>

| Risk                                   | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Performance Overhead                   | - Use efficient algorithms and data structures.  - Implement asynchronous processing in the ESM. - Benchmark frequently and optimize critical code paths.                                                                |
| Incorrect Security Implementation       | - Thorough code reviews. - Extensive testing (unit, integration, security). - Follow secure coding best practices.                                                                                                     |
| Compatibility Issues with Existing MCP | - Prioritize non-breaking changes (optional `security` field). - Provide clear migration guides for existing MCP users. - Use feature flags to enable/disable GUARDRAIL features.                                          |
| Key Management Vulnerabilities        | - Use a secure key exchange protocol (e.g., a robust implementation of Diffie-Hellman or similar). - Never hardcode secrets. - Integrate with a secure key management system (e.g., Vault) in later phases.                      |
| Complexity of Implementation           | - Start with a simplified implementation (core ESM modules only). - Break down the implementation into smaller, manageable tasks. - Use clear and consistent coding styles. - Thorough documentation.                       |
