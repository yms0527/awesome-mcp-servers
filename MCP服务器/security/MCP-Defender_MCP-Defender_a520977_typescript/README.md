🛡️  MCP Defender is a desktop app that protects AI apps like Cursor from a variety of attacks.

🚦 All MCP tool call requests and responses from AI apps are automatically proxied through MCP Defender.

🔎  The intercepted data is then checked against a set of signatures.

🔐  If anything harmful is detected, MCP Defender alerts you and asks if you want to allow or block the tool call.
