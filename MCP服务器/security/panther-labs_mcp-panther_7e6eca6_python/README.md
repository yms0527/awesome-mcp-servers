## Panther Configuration

**Follow these steps to configure your API credentials and environment.**

1. Create an API token in Panther:
   - Navigate to Settings (gear icon) → API Tokens
   - Create a new token with the following permissions (recommended read-only approach to start):
   - <details>
     <summary><strong>View Required Permissions</strong></summary>

     ![Screenshot of Panther Token permissions](.github/panther-token-perms-2.png)

     </details>

2. Store the generated token securely (e.g., 1Password)

3. Copy the Panther instance URL from your browser (e.g., `https://YOUR-PANTHER-INSTANCE.domain`)
    - Note: This must include `https://`

## MCP Server Installation

**Choose one of the following installation methods:**

### Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using our pre-built Docker image:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-panther": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "-e", "PANTHER_INSTANCE_URL",
        "-e", "PANTHER_API_TOKEN",
        "--rm",
        "ghcr.io/panther-labs/mcp-panther"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PANTHER_INSTANCE_URL": "https://YOUR-PANTHER-INSTANCE.domain",
        "PANTHER_API_TOKEN": "YOUR-API-KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Version Pinning:** For production stability, pin to a specific version tag:

```json
"ghcr.io/panther-labs/mcp-panther:v2.2.0"
```

Available tags can be found on the [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/panther-labs/mcp-panther/pkgs/container/mcp-panther).

### UVX

For Python users, you can run directly from PyPI using uvx:

1. [Install UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

2. Configure your MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-panther": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-panther"],
      "env": {
        "PANTHER_INSTANCE_URL": "https://YOUR-PANTHER-INSTANCE.domain",
        "PANTHER_API_TOKEN": "YOUR-PANTHER-API-TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Version Pinning:** For production stability, pin to a specific version:

```json
"args": ["mcp-panther==2.2.0"]
```

Available versions can be found on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mcp-panther/).

## MCP Client Setup

### Cursor

[Follow the instructions here](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#configuring-mcp-servers) to configure your project or global MCP configuration. **It's VERY IMPORTANT that you do not check this file into version control.**

Once configured, navigate to Cursor Settings > MCP to view the running server:

<img src=".github/panther-mcp-cursor-config.png" width="500" alt="Cursor MCP Configuration Screenshot" />

**Tips:**

- Be specific about where you want to generate new rules by using the `@` symbol and then typing a specific directory.
- For more reliability during tool use, try selecting a specific model, like Claude 3.7 Sonnet.
- If your MCP Client is failing to find any tools from the Panther MCP Server, try restarting the Client and ensuring the MCP server is running. In Cursor, refresh the MCP Server and start a new chat.

### Claude Code

[Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs) is Anthropic's official CLI tool. Add the Panther MCP server using Docker:

```bash
claude mcp add-json panther '{
  "command": "docker",
  "args": [
    "run",
    "-i",
    "-e", "PANTHER_INSTANCE_URL",
    "-e", "PANTHER_API_TOKEN",
    "--rm",
    "ghcr.io/panther-labs/mcp-panther"
  ],
  "env": {
    "PANTHER_INSTANCE_URL": "https://YOUR-PANTHER-INSTANCE.domain",
    "PANTHER_API_TOKEN": "YOUR-API-TOKEN"
  }
}'
```

Alternatively, using UVX:

```bash
claude mcp add-json panther '{
  "command": "uvx",
  "args": ["mcp-panther"],
  "env": {
    "PANTHER_INSTANCE_URL": "https://YOUR-PANTHER-INSTANCE.domain",
    "PANTHER_API_TOKEN": "YOUR-API-TOKEN"
  }
}'
```

After adding, verify the server is configured:

```bash
claude mcp list
```

### Claude Desktop

To use with Claude Desktop, manually configure your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

1. Open the Claude Desktop settings and navigate to the Developer tab
2. Click "Edit Config" to open the configuration file
3. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-panther": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-panther"],
      "env": {
        "PANTHER_INSTANCE_URL": "https://YOUR-PANTHER-INSTANCE.domain",
        "PANTHER_API_TOKEN": "YOUR-PANTHER-API-TOKEN"

## Running the Server

The MCP Panther server supports multiple transport protocols:

### STDIO (Default)

For local development and MCP client integration:

```bash
uv run python -m mcp_panther.server
```

### Streamable HTTP

For running as a persistent web service, use the HTTP transport. This is ideal for:
- Long-running server deployments
- Multiple clients connecting to the same server
- Testing and debugging with continuous log monitoring

#### Using Docker Run (Detached)

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name panther-mcp-server \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -e PANTHER_INSTANCE_URL=https://YOUR-PANTHER-INSTANCE.domain \
  -e PANTHER_API_TOKEN=YOUR-API-TOKEN \
  -e MCP_TRANSPORT=streamable-http \
  -e MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  -e MCP_PORT=8000 \
  -e LOG_LEVEL=INFO \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/panther-labs/mcp-panther:latest
```

#### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  panther-mcp:
    image: ghcr.io/panther-labs/mcp-panther:latest
    container_name: panther-mcp-server
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - PANTHER_INSTANCE_URL=https://YOUR-PANTHER-INSTANCE.domain
      - PANTHER_API_TOKEN=YOUR-API-TOKEN
      - MCP_TRANSPORT=streamable-http
      - MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0
      - MCP_PORT=8000
      - LOG_LEVEL=INFO
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Start the server:

```bash
# Start in detached mode
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop the server
docker-compose down
```

#### Connecting Claude Code to HTTP Server

**Important:** The server runs on HTTP (not HTTPS). Configure Claude Code with the `http://` URL:

```bash
# Add the HTTP endpoint (note: http:// not https://)
claude mcp add-json panther-http '{
  "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp"
}'

# Verify configuration
claude mcp list
```

#### Testing the Connection

```bash
# Test the HTTP endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/mcp

# View server logs
docker logs -f panther-mcp-server
# Or with docker-compose:
docker-compose logs -f
```

You can also test using the FastMCP client:

```python
import asyncio
from fastmcp import Client

async def test_connection():
    async with Client("http://localhost:8000/mcp") as client:
        tools = await client.list_tools()
        print(f"Available tools: {len(tools)}")

asyncio.run(test_connection())
```

#### Troubleshooting Streamable HTTP

**Port Already in Use**

If you see `Bind for 0.0.0.0:8000 failed: port is already allocated`:

```bash
# Check what's using the port
lsof -i :8000

# Stop conflicting containers
docker ps | grep panther
docker stop <container-id>

# Or use a different port via MCP_PORT environment variable:
-e MCP_PORT=8080
# Then connect to: http://localhost:8080/mcp
```

**Invalid HTTP Request Warnings**

If you see `WARNING: Invalid HTTP request received` in the logs, this usually means:
- Claude Code is trying to connect via HTTPS instead of HTTP
- Check your configuration uses `http://` not `https://`
- Verify with: `claude mcp list`

### Environment Variables

- `MCP_TRANSPORT`: Set transport type (`stdio` or `streamable-http`)
- `MCP_PORT`: Port for HTTP transport (default: 3000)
- `MCP_HOST`: Host for HTTP transport (default: 127.0.0.1)
- `MCP_LOG_FILE`: Log file path (optional)

## Security Best Practices

We highly recommends the following MCP security best practices:

- **Apply strict least-privilege to Panther API tokens.** Scope tokens to the minimal permissions required and bind them to an IP allow-list or CIDR range so they're useless if exfiltrated. Rotate credentials on a preferred interval (e.g., every 30d).
- **Host the MCP server in a locked-down sandbox (e.g., Docker) with read-only mounts.** This confines any compromise to a minimal blast radius.
- **Monitor credential access to Panther and monitor for anomalies.** Write a Panther rule!
- **Run only trusted, officially signed MCP servers.** Verify digital signatures or checksums before running, audit the tool code, and avoid community tools from unofficial publishers.

## Troubleshooting

Check the server logs for detailed error messages: `tail -n 20 -F ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log`. Common issues and solutions are listed below.

### Running tools

- If you get a `{"success": false, "message": "Failed to [action]: Request failed (HTTP 403): {\"error\": \"forbidden\"}"}` error, it likely means your API token lacks the particular permission needed by the tool.
- Ensure your Panther Instance URL is correctly set. You can view this in the `config://panther` resource from your MCP Client.
