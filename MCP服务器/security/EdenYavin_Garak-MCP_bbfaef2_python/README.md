## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.11 or higher**: This project requires Python 3.11 or newer.
   ```bash
   # Check your Python version
   python --version
   ```

2. **Install uv**: A fast Python package installer and resolver.
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```
   Or use Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew install uv
   ```
3. **Optional: Ollama**: If you want to run attacks on ollama models be sure that the ollama server is running.

```bash
ollama serve
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BIGdeadLock/Garak-MCP.git
```
2. Configure your MCP Host (Claude Desktop ,Cursor, etc): 

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "garak-mcp": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["--directory", "path-to/Garak-MCP", "run", "garak-server"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}

```

## Running Vulnerability Scans

You can run Garak vulnerability scans directly using the included CLI tool.

### Prerequisites for Scanning

1. **Ollama must be running**:
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```

2. **Pull a model to scan**:
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama2
   ```

### Using the CLI Scanner

After installation, you can use the `garak-scan` command:

```bash
# List available Ollama models
uv run garak-scan --list-models

# Scan a specific model with all probes
uv run garak-scan --model llama2

# Scan with specific probes
uv run garak-scan --model llama2 --probes encoding

# Scan with custom output directory
uv run garak-scan --model llama2 --output-dir ./my_scans

# Run multiple parallel attempts
uv run garak-scan --model llama2 --parallel-attempts 4
```

### Scan Results

Scan results are saved in the `output/` directory (or your specified directory) as JSONL files. Each scan creates a timestamped report file:

```
output/scan_llama2_20250125_143022.report.jsonl
```

### GitHub Actions Integration

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically runs vulnerability scans:

- **Triggers**: Push to main/master, pull requests, weekly schedule (Mondays at 2am UTC)
- **Manual runs**: Go to Actions → Garak LLM Vulnerability Scan → Run workflow
- **Custom options**: Specify model and probes when running manually
- **Results**: Scan results are uploaded as workflow artifacts

To enable automated scanning:
1. Ensure the workflow file exists at `.github/workflows/garak-scan.yml`
2. Push to your repository
3. Check the Actions tab to view scan results
