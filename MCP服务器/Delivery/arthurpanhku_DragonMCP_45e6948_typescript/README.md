## 🌟 What is DragonMCP?

DragonMCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to bridge the gap between AI Agents and local life services in **Greater China (Mainland China, Hong Kong) and Asia**.

It aims to solve the "last mile" problem between AI Agents and real-world services.

---

## 🔥 Live Demo: MTR Real-time Schedule

We have implemented the **MTR (Mass Transit Railway) Query Tool** as our first MVP. AI Agents can now fetch real-time train schedules directly from MTR's Open API.

**Scenario**:
> User: "When is the next train from Admiralty to Central?"

**Agent Response**:
> "Next Island Line train from Admiralty to Central (towards Kennedy Town):
> - Arriving in: 2 min(s) (10:30:00)
> - Subsequent trains: 5 min(s) (10:33:00)"

*(Try it yourself by connecting DragonMCP to your MCP client!)*

## ⚠️ Security & Disclaimer

> **IMPORTANT**: This project includes Mock implementations for sensitive services like payments (WeChat Pay, Alipay) and ride-hailing (Didi).

*   **Do NOT** use real financial data or personal credentials in the current version.
*   The payment tools (`wechat_pay_create`, `alipay_pay_create`) currently return **fake data** for demonstration purposes only. No actual money is transferred.
*   When integrating real APIs in the future, ensure you follow strict security protocols (OAuth, HTTPS, Token Management).

## 🏗️ Architecture

DragonMCP acts as a middleware between AI Agents and various local service APIs.

## ❓ FAQ & Troubleshooting

### Q: Why do I get "Station not found" for MTR query?
A: Currently, only **Island Line** and **Tsuen Wan Line** are supported. Please check if the station name is spelled correctly (e.g., "Admiralty", "Central", "Mong Kok").

### Q: How do I get an Amap (Gaode) API Key?
A: You need to register at the [Amap Open Platform](https://lbs.amap.com/), create a "Web Service" application, and copy the Key to your `.env` file as `AMAP_API_KEY`.

### Q: Can I use this for real payments?
A: **No.** The current payment tools are mocks. Do not use them for real transactions.

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome all contributions! Whether you are a developer, designer, or product thinker.

### We need help with:
1.  **Playwright Scripts**: Simulating food delivery apps (Meituan/Ele.me) web flows.
