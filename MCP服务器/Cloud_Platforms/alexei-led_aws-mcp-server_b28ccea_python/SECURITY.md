## Security Best Practices

When using AWS MCP Server:

1. **Use Docker deployment** - Provides strongest isolation
2. **Apply least-privilege IAM** - Limit AWS credentials to minimum required permissions
3. **Keep updated** - Use latest version for security fixes
4. **Review blocked commands** - Understand what operations are restricted in strict mode
