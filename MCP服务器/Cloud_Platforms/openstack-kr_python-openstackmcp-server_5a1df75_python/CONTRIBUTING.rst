Development Environment
=======================

The following content is a guide for contributors to set up a development environment in their local environment.

Prerequisites
=============

- This project uses uv to manage Python packages. Please set up an environment where you can use uv in your local environment for development environment setup. `Reference <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/>`_
- We use ``python3.10`` as the default version. This is to ensure compatibility with other OpenStack projects.

UV Package Build
----------------

.. code-block:: bash

    uv sync --all-groups

Pre-commit
----------

Code style is managed uniformly through ruff. We recommend setting up pre-commit hooks so that auto-formatting is applied at the commit stage.

.. code-block:: bash

    pre-commit install

Testing
=======

Unit Tests
----------

All patches related to feature additions must implement unit test code. This project uses Pytest as the testing library, and if the project has been built successfully, you can run tests with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    uv run pytest
