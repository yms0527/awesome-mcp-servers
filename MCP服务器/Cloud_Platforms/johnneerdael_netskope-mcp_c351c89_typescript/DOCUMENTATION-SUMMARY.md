```

## Next Steps

1. **Replace current README**: Replace your current README.md with README-NEW.md
2. **Review documentation**: Each file is comprehensive and can be used independently
3. **Extend as needed**: Add more tool categories (Local Broker, SCIM, etc.) following the same pattern
4. **Update links**: Ensure all internal links work in your repository structure

This documentation system provides everything you requested:
- ✅ Extensive details about all tools and functions
- ✅ Complete data schemas with Zod validation
- ✅ Tool interdependency documentation
- ✅ Real-world examples and workflow patterns
- ✅ Logical grouping with clear navigation
- ✅ Incremental structure for easy maintenance

The documentation demonstrates how your MCP server transforms complex Netskope NPA operations into simple, AI-driven conversations through intelligent tool orchestration.
