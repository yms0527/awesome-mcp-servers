Manage AWS S3 buckets and objects from your AI assistant. Browse files, upload and download content, and generate presigned URLs.

```bash
npx mcp-server-s3
```

> Works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, and any MCP client. Uses your existing AWS credentials (`~/.aws/credentials` or environment variables).

## Why

S3 is the most widely used cloud storage service, but managing it from the command line means remembering `aws s3 ls`, `aws s3 cp`, presigned URL syntax, and various flags. Google has an official MCP for GCS, Cloudflare has one for R2, but AWS S3 doesn't have a polished standalone MCP server on npm. This one lets you ask your assistant to list buckets, download a config file, upload content, or generate a temporary sharing link. It uses the standard AWS credential chain, so if your CLI already works, this works too.

## Tools

| Tool            | What it does                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `list_buckets`  | List all S3 buckets in your AWS account.               |
| `list_objects`  | List objects in a bucket, with optional prefix filter. |
| `get_object`    | Download and read an object's content as text.         |
| `put_object`    | Upload text content to an S3 object.                   |
| `delete_object` | Delete an object from a bucket.                        |
| `presigned_url` | Generate a temporary presigned URL for an object.      |
| `bucket_info`   | Check if a bucket exists and get basic info.           |

## Quick Start

### Cursor

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "s3": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-s3"],
      "env": {
        "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1",
        "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "your-access-key",
        "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "your-secret-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "s3": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-s3"],
      "env": {
        "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1",
        "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "your-access-key",
        "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "your-secret-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### VS Code

Configure the MCP server to run `npx mcp-server-s3` with `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` in the environment.

## Authentication

The server uses the standard AWS credential chain:

1. **Environment variables**: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`
2. **Shared credentials file**: `~/.aws/credentials`
3. **IAM roles**: when running on EC2, ECS, Lambda, or similar

Set `AWS_REGION` (defaults to `us-east-1`) and make sure your credentials have the necessary S3 permissions: `s3:ListBuckets`, `s3:ListBucket`, `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`, `s3:DeleteObject`, `s3:HeadBucket`.

## Example prompts

- "List all my S3 buckets"
- "Show me the files in my-bucket/uploads/"
- "Download the config.json from my-bucket"
- "Upload this content to my-bucket/notes.txt"
- "Generate a presigned URL for this file that expires in 1 hour"

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm test
npm run format
npm run lint
```
