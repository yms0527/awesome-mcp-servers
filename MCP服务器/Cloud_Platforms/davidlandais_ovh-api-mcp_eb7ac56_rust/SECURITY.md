## Security measures

This project applies the following hardening:

- Sandboxed JavaScript execution (QuickJS) with memory, stack, and CPU limits
- Every API call validated against the loaded OpenAPI spec
- Path injection prevention (`?`, `#`, `..` rejected)
- Secrets stored with `secrecy` (zeroized on drop)
- HTTP redirects disabled (credential leak prevention)
- Docker image runs as non-root user
