# 202504-2: Strict versioning for tools.yaml file

**Date**: 08/04/2025

### Context
With tools.yaml being externalized and allowing user customization, there's a risk of incompatibility between the tool definitions and the application code. Changes to the schema or expected tool definitions could lead to runtime errors that are difficult to diagnose.

### Decision
Implement strict versioning for the tools.yaml file with version validation at startup. The application will define a required/current version, check if the provided tools.yaml file uses this version, and fail fast if there's a version mismatch.

### Rationale
1. **Compatibility Assurance**
   - Prevents runtime errors caused by incompatible tool definitions
   - Clearly communicates version requirements to users
   - Makes version mismatches immediately apparent

2. **Error Handling**
   - Provides clear error messages about version mismatches
   - Fails fast instead of letting subtle errors occur during operation
   - Guides users toward proper resolution

3. **Recovery Path**
   - Users can update their tools.yaml file manually to match the required version
   - Alternatively, users can simply delete their customized file and let the application regenerate it
   - Regeneration uses the embedded version which is guaranteed to be compatible

4. **Upgrade Management**
   - Clear versioning creates explicit upgrade paths
   - Version checks provide a mechanism to enforce schema migrations
   - Makes breaking changes in tool definitions more manageable

### Trade-offs

**Benefits**
- Prevents subtle runtime errors
- Provides clear error messages
- Offers straightforward recovery options
- Makes version incompatibilities immediately apparent
- Simplifies upgrade paths

**Challenges**
- Need to manage version numbers across releases
- Must communicate version changes to users
- Requires additional validation logic at startup
- Necessitates documentation of version compatibility
