    """Get enablement guide for AWS Application Signals.

    Use this tool when the user wants to:
    - Enable observability, monitoring, or Application Signals for their AWS service
    - Set up automatic instrumentation for their application on AWS
    - Instrument their service running on EC2, ECS, Lambda, or EKS

    This tool returns step-by-step enablement instructions that guide you through
    modifying your infrastructure and application code to enable Application Signals,
    which is the preferred way to enable automatic instrumentation for services on AWS.

    Before calling this tool:
    1. Ensure you know where the application code is located and that you have read/write permissions
    2. Ensure you know where the IaC code is located and that you have read/write permissions
    3. If the user provides relative paths or descriptions (e.g., "./infrastructure", "in the root"):
       - Use the Bash tool to run 'pwd' to get the current working directory
       - Use file exploration tools to locate the directories
       - Convert relative paths to absolute paths before calling this tool
    4. This tool REQUIRES absolute paths for both iac_directory and app_directory parameters

    After calling this tool, you should:
    1. Review the enablement guide and create a visible, trackable checklist of required changes
       - Use your system's task tracking mechanism (todo lists, markdown checklists, etc.)
       - Each item should be granular enough to complete in one step
       - Mark items as complete as you finish them to track progress
       - This allows you to resume work if the context window fills up
    2. Work through the checklist systematically, one item at a time:
       - Identify the specific file(s) that need modification for this step
       - Read only the relevant file(s) (DO NOT load all IaC and app files at once)
       - Apply the changes as specified in the guide
    3. Keep context focused: Only load files needed for the current checklist item

    Important guidelines:
    - Use ABSOLUTE PATHS when reading and writing files
    - Do NOT modify actual application logic files (.py, .js, .java source code), only
      modify IaC code, Dockerfiles, and dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml,
      package.json, pom.xml, build.gradle, *.csproj, etc.) as instructed by the guide.
    - Read application files if needed to understand the setup, but avoid modifying them

    Args:
        service_platform: The AWS platform where the service runs.
            MUST be one of: 'ec2', 'ecs', 'lambda', 'eks' (lowercase, exact match).
            To help user determine: check their IaC for ECS services, Lambda functions, EKS deployments, or EC2 instances.
        service_language: The service's programming language.
            MUST be one of: 'python', 'nodejs', 'java', 'dotnet' (lowercase, exact match).
            IMPORTANT: Use 'nodejs' (not 'js', 'node', or 'javascript'), 'dotnet' (not 'csharp' or 'c#').
            To help user determine: check for package.json (nodejs), requirements.txt (python), pom.xml (java), or .csproj (dotnet).
        iac_directory: ABSOLUTE path to the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) directory (e.g., /home/user/project/infrastructure)
        app_directory: ABSOLUTE path to the application code directory (e.g., /home/user/project/app)
