## Available Tools

### Enablement & Setup Tools

#### 1. **`get_enablement_guide`** - Application Signals Enablement Assistant
**Enable observability through AI-guided autonomous code modifications**

Use this tool to enable AWS Application Signals through agentic enablement. The tool returns a curated guide that the AI agent follows to autonomously make necessary code changes to your IaC, Dockerfiles, and dependency files. The guide is customized for your service platform (EC2, ECS, Lambda, EKS) and programming language (Python, Node.js, Java).

**Prerequisites:**
- **Enable Start Discovery** in your AWS account and region before using this tool
  - This is a one-time setup that creates the **AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchApplicationSignals** service-linked role
  - Navigate to CloudWatch console → Services → "Start discovering your Services" → Enable Application Signals
  - See the [enablement guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Application-Signals-Enable.html) for detailed steps

**How it works:**
- Returns a curated enablement guide as a prompt for the AI agent
- The AI agent follows the guide to autonomously modify your code
- The guide also serves as knowledge you can ask follow-up questions about
- Supports interactive Q&A throughout the enablement process

**When to use this tool:**
- Enable observability, monitoring, or Application Signals for your AWS service
- Set up automatic instrumentation for your application on AWS
- Instrument your service running on EC2, ECS, Lambda, or EKS
- Add tracing, metrics, or telemetry to your AWS application

**Requirements:**
- Write permissions to IaC files, Dockerfiles, and dependency files
- Platform must be one of: `ec2`, `ecs`, `lambda`, `eks`
- Language must be one of: `python`, `nodejs`, `java`

**Recommendations:**
- Use absolute paths for both IaC and application directories (less ambiguous for AI agents)
- Provide both directory paths in your initial prompt for faster enablement

**Best Practice Prompts:**

Good prompts (specific and complete):
```
"Enable Application Signals for my Python service running on ECS.
My app code is in /home/user/myapp and IaC is in /home/user/myapp/infrastructure"

"I want to add observability to my Node.js Lambda function.
The Lambda code is at /Users/dev/checkout-service and
the CDK infrastructure is at /Users/dev/checkout-service/cdk"

"Help me instrument my Java application on EC2 with Application Signals.
Application directory: /opt/apps/payment-api
Terraform code: /opt/apps/payment-api/terraform"
```

Less effective prompts:
```
"Enable monitoring for my app"
→ Missing: platform, language, paths

"Enable Application Signals. My code is in ./src and IaC is in ./infrastructure"
→ Problem: Relative paths instead of absolute paths

"Enable Application Signals for my ECS service at /home/user/myapp"
→ Missing: programming language
```

Quick template:
```
"Enable Application Signals for my [LANGUAGE] service on [PLATFORM].
App code: [ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_APP]
IaC code: [ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_IAC]"
```

  service_targets='[{"Type":"service","Data":{"Service":{"Type":"Service","Name":"*payment*"}}}]',
  auditors="slo,operation_metric"
)

Results: Found 3 payment services with the following findings:

🔴 CRITICAL FINDINGS:
• payment-api-service: SLO breach detected - Latency SLO violated (p99: 2.1s > 1.5s threshold)
• payment-processor: High error rate detected (8.2% > 5% threshold)

⚠️ WARNING FINDINGS:
• payment-gateway: Dependency timeout issues with external payment provider

✅ HEALTHY:
• payment-validator: All metrics within normal ranges

Recommendations:
1. Investigate payment-api-service latency issues - check database connection pool
2. Review payment-processor error logs for root cause analysis
3. Consider circuit breaker pattern for payment-gateway external dependencies
```

### Example 2: SLO Breach Root Cause Analysis
```
User: "I have an SLO breach for my checkout service. Can you help me investigate?"
Assistant: I'll help you investigate the SLO breach. Let me first get the SLO configuration and then perform a comprehensive root cause analysis.

[Uses get_slo to understand configuration]
[Then uses audit_slos with auditors="all" for comprehensive analysis]

audit_slos(
  slo_targets='[{"Type":"slo","Data":{"Slo":{"SloName":"checkout-service-latency-slo"}}}]',
  auditors="all"
)

Root Cause Analysis Results:

🔴 SLO BREACH CONFIRMED:
• checkout-service-latency-slo: 87.3% attainment (< 95% goal)
• Breach duration: 2.5 hours
• Impact: 1,247 requests affected

🔍 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
• Database connection pool exhaustion detected
• Trace analysis shows 95% of slow requests waiting for DB connections
• Dependency on payment-service also showing elevated latency

📊 SUPPORTING EVIDENCE:
• P99 latency: 3.2s (threshold: 2.0s)
• Error rate spike: 12% during breach period
• 15 error traces with "connection timeout" messages

🛠️ RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
1. Increase database connection pool size from 10 to 25
2. Implement connection pool monitoring alerts
3. Review payment-service dependency performance
4. Consider implementing request queuing for high load periods
```

### Example 3: Operation-Level Performance Investigation
```
User: "The GET operations in my payment services are slow. Can you investigate?"
Assistant: I'll investigate the performance of GET operations specifically in your payment services using operation-level analysis.

[Uses audit_service_operations for precise operation targeting]

audit_service_operations(
  operation_targets='[{"Type":"service_operation","Data":{"ServiceOperation":{"Service":{"Type":"Service","Name":"*payment*"},"Operation":"*GET*","MetricType":"Latency"}}}]',
  auditors="operation_metric,trace"
)

Operation Performance Analysis Results:

🎯 GET OPERATIONS ANALYZED:
• payment-api: GET /api/payments/{id} - P99: 1.8s
• payment-api: GET /api/payments/history - P99: 3.2s ⚠️
• payment-processor: GET /api/process/status - P99: 0.8s ✅

🔴 PERFORMANCE ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
• GET /api/payments/history: Consistently slow (3.2s avg)
  - Root cause: Full table scan on payments table
  - 89% of requests show database query time > 2.5s
  - Missing index on user_id + created_date columns

📈 PERFORMANCE RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add composite index: CREATE INDEX idx_payments_user_date ON payments(user_id, created_date)
2. Implement pagination for history endpoint (limit 50 records)
3. Consider caching for frequently accessed payment histories
4. Add query timeout protection (max 5s)

🚀 EXPECTED IMPROVEMENT:
• Estimated latency reduction: 3.2s → 0.4s (87% improvement)
• Database load reduction: ~75%
```

### Example 4: Transaction Search for 100% Trace Visibility
```
User: "I want to analyze all the errors in my checkout service from the last hour"
Assistant: I'll use Transaction Search to analyze all errors with 100% trace visibility (no sampling).

[Uses search_transaction_spans for complete trace data]

search_transaction_spans(
  log_group_name="aws/spans",
  query_string='FILTER attributes.aws.local.service = "checkout-service" and attributes.http.status_code >= 400 | STATS count() as error_count by attributes.http.status_code, attributes.aws.local.operation | SORT error_count DESC | LIMIT 20',
  start_time="2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  end_time="2024-01-15T11:00:00Z"
)

✅ Transaction Search Results (100% sampled data):

ERROR BREAKDOWN (Last Hour):
• HTTP 500 errors: 47 occurrences
  - POST /api/checkout/complete: 31 errors
  - POST /api/checkout/validate: 16 errors

• HTTP 404 errors: 23 occurrences
  - GET /api/checkout/{id}: 23 errors

• HTTP 503 errors: 12 occurrences
  - POST /api/checkout/payment: 12 errors

🔍 KEY INSIGHTS:
• 82 total errors out of 1,247 requests (6.6% error rate)
• Most errors (66%) in checkout completion flow
• Service unavailable errors correlate with payment service dependency

🛠️ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED:
1. Investigate checkout completion logic for 500 errors
2. Add validation for checkout ID existence (404s)
3. Implement circuit breaker for payment service calls (503s)
```

### Example 5: Service Discovery and Overview
```
User: "What services are being monitored and what's their current health status?"
Assistant: I'll get an overview of all monitored services and their health status.

```

### Example 6: Canary Failure Analysis and Root Cause Investigation
```
User: "My Pet Clinic canaries are failing. Can you help me diagnose the issues?"
Assistant: I'll analyze your Pet Clinic canaries to identify the root causes of failures.

[Uses analyze_canary_failures for comprehensive canary analysis]

analyze_canary_failures(canary_name="pc-visit-vet")
analyze_canary_failures(canary_name="pc-add-visit")
analyze_canary_failures(canary_name="webapp-erorrpagecanary")

🔍 CANARY FAILURE ANALYSIS RESULTS:

🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:

**pc-visit-vet canary:**
• Root Cause: S3 bucket access issue
• Error Pattern: Exit status 127, "No such file or directory"
• Failure Count: 5 consecutive failures
• IAM Analysis: ✅ Role exists but S3 bucket ARN patterns incorrect in policies

**pc-add-visit canary:**
• Root Cause: Selector timeout + backend service errors
• Error Pattern: 30000ms timeout waiting for UI element + MissingFormatArgumentException
• Backend Issue: Format specifier '% o' error in BedrockRuntimeV1Service.invokeTitanModel()
• Performance: 34 second average response time, 0% success rate

**webapp-erorrpagecanary:**
• Root Cause: Browser target close during selector wait
• Error Pattern: "Target closed" waiting for `#jsError` selector

5. Review canary timeout configurations - consider increasing from 30s to 60s
6. Implement circuit breaker pattern for external service dependencies

**Monitoring (Medium Priority):**
7. Add Application Signals monitoring for canary success rates
8. Set up alerts for consecutive canary failures (>3 failures)
9. Implement canary health dashboard with real-time status

🎯 EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
• S3 access fix: Immediate resolution of pc-visit-vet failures
• Backend service fix: 80%+ improvement in Pet Clinic canary success rates
• Infrastructure improvements: Reduced browser target close errors
• Enhanced monitoring: Proactive failure detection and faster resolution
```

### Example 7: Change Events Timeline Analysis
```
User: "My checkout-service alarm is firing. What changed recently?"
Assistant: I'll investigate recent changes to your checkout-service that might have triggered the alarm.

[Uses list_change_events to correlate alarm timing with recent changes]

list_change_events(
  start_time="2024-01-15T12:00:00Z",  # 6 hours before alarm
  end_time="2024-01-15T18:00:00Z",   # Current time
  service_key_attributes='{"Name": "checkout-service", "Environment": "eks:production"}'
)

🚨 **ALARM CORRELATION ANALYSIS:**

**Alarm Details:**
• Trigger Time: 15:30 UTC
• Metric: ErrorRate > 5%
• Current Value: 12.3%

**RECENT CHANGES DETECTED:**
• 14:45 UTC: DEPLOYMENT - UpdateService (checkout-service v2.1.4)
• 15:15 UTC: CONFIGURATION - UpdateTaskDefinition (memory limit increased)
• 15:25 UTC: DEPLOYMENT - UpdateService (rollback attempted)

🎯 **TIMELINE CORRELATION:**
• Deployment at 14:45 UTC
• Alarm triggered 45 minutes later (15:30 UTC)
• Rollback attempt 5 minutes before alarm (15:25 UTC)
• Suggests deployment introduced errors, rollback may be incomplete

💡 **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**
1. Verify rollback completion status
2. Check if v2.1.4 introduced breaking changes
3. Monitor error logs from 14:45 UTC onwards
4. Consider full rollback to previous stable version
```

### Example 8: Multi-Service Change Pattern Analysis
```
User: "Multiple services are having issues. Show me all recent changes across my environment."
Assistant: I'll analyze recent changes across your environment. Since you want to see all changes without filtering to specific services, I'll use the ListServiceStates API which provides current service state information.

[Uses list_change_events with comprehensive_history=False for environment-wide analysis]

list_change_events(
  start_time="2024-01-15T06:00:00Z",  # Last 12 hours
  end_time="2024-01-15T18:00:00Z",
  comprehensive_history=False,  # Uses ListServiceStates API - no service filtering required
  max_results=100
)

🌐 **ENVIRONMENT-WIDE CHANGE ANALYSIS:**

**SERVICE STATE SUMMARY:**
• payment-service: Recent deployment detected (v2.1.4)
• checkout-service: Configuration change detected (memory limits updated)
• user-service: Stable - no recent changes
• api-gateway: Recent scaling event detected

**RECENT CHANGE INDICATORS:**
• Services with recent deployments: 3
• Services with configuration changes: 2
• Services with scaling events: 1
• Stable services: 2

🔍 **CHANGE CORRELATION ANALYSIS:**

**Services Requiring Investigation:**
• payment-service: Last deployment may correlate with reported issues
• checkout-service: Configuration changes might be reactive to problems
• api-gateway: Scaling events suggest increased load or performance issues

💡 **RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:**

For detailed change history of specific problematic services, I can investigate further:
1. Get service details first: get_service_detail("payment-service")
2. Then query comprehensive change history: list_change_events() with service_key_attributes
3. Correlate specific change timing with issue onset

Would you like me to investigate the change history for any specific service in detail?
```

        "iam:GetPolicyVersion"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Environment Variables

- `AWS_PROFILE` - AWS profile name to use for authentication (defaults to `default` profile)
- `AWS_REGION` - AWS region (defaults to us-east-1)
- `MCP_CLOUDWATCH_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_LOG_LEVEL` - Logging level (defaults to INFO)
- `AUDITOR_LOG_PATH` - Path for audit log files (defaults to /tmp)

### AWS Credentials

This server uses AWS profiles for authentication. Set the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable to use a specific profile from your `~/.aws/credentials` file.

The server will use the standard AWS credential chain via boto3, which includes:
- AWS Profile specified by `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable
- Default profile from AWS credentials file
- IAM roles when running on EC2, ECS, Lambda, etc.

### Transaction Search Configuration

For 100% trace visibility, enable AWS X-Ray Transaction Search:
1. Configure X-Ray to send traces to CloudWatch Logs
2. Set destination to 'CloudWatchLogs' with status 'ACTIVE'
3. This enables the `search_transaction_spans()` tool for complete observability

Without Transaction Search, you'll only have access to 5% sampled trace data through X-Ray.

## Development

This server is part of the AWS Labs MCP collection. For development and contribution guidelines, please see the main repository documentation.

### Running Tests

To run the comprehensive test suite that validates all use case examples and tool functionality:

```bash
cd src/cloudwatch-applicationsignals-mcp-server
python -m pytest tests/test_use_case_examples.py -v
```

This test file verifies that all use case examples in the tool documentation call the correct tools with the right parameters and target formats. It includes tests for:

- All documented use cases for `audit_services()`, `audit_slos()`, and `audit_service_operations()`
- Target format validation (service, SLO, and operation targets)
- Wildcard pattern expansion functionality
- Auditor selection for different scenarios
- JSON format validation for all documentation examples

The tests use mocked AWS clients to prevent real API calls while validating the tool logic and parameter handling.
