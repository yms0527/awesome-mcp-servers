## IMPORTANT: Each API call costs $0.01 - use filters and specific date ranges to minimize charges.

## Critical Rules
- Comparison periods: exactly 1 month, start on day 1 (e.g., "2025-04-01" to "2025-05-01")
- UsageQuantity: Recommended to filter by USAGE_TYPE, USAGE_TYPE_GROUP or results are meaningless
- When user says "last X months": Use complete calendar months, not partial periods
- get_cost_comparison_drivers: returns only top 10 most significant drivers

## Query Pattern Mapping

| User Query Pattern | Recommended Tool | Notes |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------|
| "What were my costs for..." | get_cost_and_usage | Use for historical cost analysis |
| "How much did I spend on..." | get_cost_and_usage | Filter by service/region as needed |
| "Show me costs by..." | get_cost_and_usage | Set group_by parameter accordingly |
| "Compare costs between..." | get_cost_and_usage_comparisons | Ensure exactly 1 month periods |
| "Why did my costs change..." | get_cost_comparison_drivers | Returns top 10 drivers only |
| "What caused my bill to..." | get_cost_comparison_drivers | Good for root cause analysis |
| "Predict/forecast my costs..." | get_cost_forecast | Works best with specific services |
| "What will I spend on..." | get_cost_forecast | Can filter by dimension |

## Cost Optimization Tips
- Always use specific date ranges rather than broad periods
- Filter by specific services when possible to reduce data processed
- For usage metrics, always filter by USAGE_TYPE or USAGE_TYPE_GROUP to get meaningful results
- Combine related questions into a single query where possible
