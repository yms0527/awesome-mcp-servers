# SageMaker Unified Studio MCP for Spark Upgrade

A fully managed remote MCP server that provides specialized tools and guidance for upgrading Apache Spark applications on Amazon EMR. This server accelerates Spark version upgrades through automated analysis, code transformation, and validation capabilities.

**Important Note**: Not all MCP clients today support remote servers. Please make sure that your client supports remote MCP servers or that you have a suitable proxy setup to use this server.

## Key Features & Capabilities

- **Project Analysis & Planning**: Deep analysis of Spark application structure, dependencies, and API usage to generate comprehensive step-by-step upgrade plans with risk assessment
- **Automated Code Transformation**: Automated PySpark and Scala code updates for version compatibility, handling API changes and deprecations
- **Dependency & Build Management**: Update and manage Maven/SBT/pip dependencies and build environments for target Spark versions with iterative error resolution
- **Comprehensive Testing & Validation**: Execute unit tests, integration tests and EMR validation jobs and validates the upgraded application against target spark version
- **Data Quality Validation**: Ensure data integrity throughout the upgrade process with validation rules
- **EMR Integration & Monitoring**: Submit and monitor EMR jobs for upgrade validation across Amazon EMR on EC2 and Amazon EMR Serverless
- **Observability & Progress Tracking**: Track upgrade progress, analyze results, and provide detailed insights throughout the upgrade process


## Architecture
The upgrade agent has three main components: any MCP-compatible AI Assistant in your development environment for interaction, the [MCP Proxy for AWS](https://github.com/aws/mcp-proxy-for-aws) that handles secure communication between your client and the MCP server, and the Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio Managed MCP Server (in preview) that provides specialized Spark upgrade tools for Amazon EMR. This diagram illustrates how you interact with the Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio Managed MCP Server through your AI Assistant.

The AI assistant will orchestrate the upgrade using specialized tools provided by the MCP server following these steps:

- **Planning**: The agent analyzes your project structure and generates or revises an upgrade plan that guides the end-to-end Spark upgrade process.

- **Compile & Build**: Agent updates the build environment and dependencies, compiles the project, and iteratively fixes build and test failures.

- **Spark code edit tool**: Applies targeted code updates to resolve Spark version incompatibilities, fixing both build-time and runtime errors.

- **Execution & Validation**: Submits remote validation jobs to EMR, monitors execution and logs, and iteratively fixes runtime and data-quality issues.

- **Observability**: Tracks upgrade progress using EMR observability tools and allows users to view upgrade analyses and status at any time.

Please refer to [Using Spark Upgrade Tools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/emr-spark-upgrade-agent-tools.html) for a list of major tools for each steps.

## Usage Examples

1. **Run the spark upgrade analysis**:
  - EMR-S
    ```
    Help me upgrade my spark application in <project-path> from EMR-EC2 version 6.0.0 to 7.12.0. you can use EMR-S Application id xxg017hmd2agxxxx and execution role <role name> to run the validation and s3 paths s3://s3-staging-path to store updated application artifacts.
    ```
  - EMR-EC2
    ```
    Upgrade my Spark application <local-project-path> from EMR-S version 6.6.0 to 7.12.0. Use EMR-EC2 Cluster j-PPXXXXTG09XX to run the validation and s3 paths s3://s3-staging-path to store updated application artifacts.
    ```

2. **List the analyses**:
   ```
   Provide me a list of analyses performed by the spark agent
   ```

3. **Describe Analysis**:
   ```
   can you explain the analysis 439715b3-xxxx-42a6-xxxx-3bf7f1fxxxx
   ```
4. **Reuse Plan for other analysis**:
    ```
    Use my upgrade_plan spark_upgrade_plan_xxx.json to upgrade my project in <project-path>
    ```

## AWS Authentication

### Step 1: Configure AWS CLI Profile
```
aws configure set profile.spark-upgrade-profile.role_arn ${IAM_ROLE}
aws configure set profile.spark-upgrade-profile.source_profile <AWS CLI Profile to assume the IAM role - ex: default>
aws configure set profile.spark-upgrade-profile.region ${SMUS_MCP_REGION}
```
### Step 2: if you are using Kiro CLI, use the following command to add the MCP configuration
```
kiro-cli-chat mcp add \
    --name "spark-upgrade" \
    --command "uvx" \
    --args "[\"mcp-proxy-for-aws@latest\",\"https://sagemaker-unified-studio-mcp.${SMUS_MCP_REGION}.api.aws/spark-upgrade/mcp\", \"--service\", \"sagemaker-unified-studio-mcp\", \"--profile\", \"spark-upgrade-profile\", \"--region\", \"${SMUS_MCP_REGION}\", \"--read-timeout\", \"180\"]" \
    --timeout 180000\
    --scope global
```
