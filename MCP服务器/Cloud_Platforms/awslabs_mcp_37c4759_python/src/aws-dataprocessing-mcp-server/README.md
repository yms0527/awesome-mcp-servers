# Amazon Data Processing MCP Server

The AWS DataProcessing MCP server provides AI code assistants with comprehensive data processing tools and real-time pipeline visibility across AWS Glue and Amazon EMR-EC2. This integration equips large language models (LLMs) with essential data engineering capabilities and contextual awareness, enabling AI code assistants to streamline data processing workflows through intelligent guidance — from initial data discovery and cataloging through complex ETL pipeline orchestration and big data analytics optimization.

Integrating the DataProcessing MCP server into AI code assistants transforms data engineering workflows across all phases, from simplifying data catalog management with automated schema discovery and data quality validation. Additionally, it streamlines ETL job creation with intelligent code generation and best practice recommendations. It accelerates big data processing through automated EMR cluster provisioning and workload optimization. Finally, it enhances troubleshooting through intelligent debugging tools and operational insights. All of this simplifies complex data operations through natural language interactions in AI code assistants.

### Write Operations Policy

For write operations, we recommend the following IAM policies:

* AWSGlueServiceRole: Enables Glue service operations including job execution, crawler runs, and data catalog modifications

**Important Security Note**: Users should exercise caution when --allow-write and --allow-sensitive-data-access modes are enabled with these broad permissions, as this combination grants significant privileges to the MCP server. Only enable these flags when necessary and in trusted environments.

**Resource Management Limitation**: The DataProcessing MCP Server can only update or delete resources that were originally created through it. Resources created by other means cannot be modified or deleted using the DataProcessing MCP Server.

## Quickstart

This quickstart guide walks you through the steps to configure the Amazon Data Processing MCP Server for use with coding assistants such as Kiro and Cursor. By following these steps, you'll setup your development environment to leverage the Data Processing MCP Server's tools for managing your Glue, EMR and Athena resources.

**Set up Kiro**

See the [Kiro IDE documentation](https://kiro.dev/docs/mcp/configuration/) or the [Kiro CLI documentation](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/mcp/configuration/) for details.

For global configuration, edit ~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json. For project-specific configuration, edit .kiro/settings/mcp.json in your project directory.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aws.dp-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "awslabs.aws-dataprocessing-mcp-server@latest",
        "--allow-write"
      ],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR",
        "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Set up Cursor**

1. Open Cursor.
2. Click the gear icon (⚙️) in the top right to open the settings panel, click **MCP**, **Add new global MCP server**.
3. Paste your MCP server definition. For example, this example shows how to configure the Data Processing MCP Server, including enabling mutating actions by adding the `--allow-write` flag to the server arguments:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aws.dp-mcp": {
      "autoApprove": [],
      "disabled": false,
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "awslabs.aws-dataprocessing-mcp-server@latest",
        "--allow-write"
      ],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR",
        "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1"
      },
      "transportType": "stdio"
    }
  }
}
```

### Windows Installation

For Windows users, the MCP server configuration format is slightly different:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "awslabs.aws-dataprocessing-mcp-server": {
      "disabled": false,
      "timeout": 60,
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "tool",
        "run",
        "--from",
        "awslabs.aws-dataprocessing-mcp-server@latest",
        "awslabs.aws-dataprocessing-mcp-server.exe"
      ],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR",
        "AWS_PROFILE": "your-aws-profile",
        "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

After a few minutes, you should see a green indicator if your MCP server definition is valid.

4. Open a chat panel in Cursor (e.g., `Ctrl/⌘ + L`).  In your Cursor chat window, enter your prompt. For example, "Look at all the tables from my account federated across GDC"

Note that this is a basic quickstart. You can enable additional capabilities, such as [running MCP servers in containers](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp?tab=readme-ov-file#running-mcp-servers-in-containers) or combining more MCP servers like the [AWS Documentation MCP Server](https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/servers/aws-documentation-mcp-server/) into a single MCP server definition. To view an example, see the [Installation and Setup](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-and-setup) guide in the AWS Labs open source MCP servers for AWS repository. To view a real-world implementation with application code in context with an MCP server, see the [Server Developer](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server) guide in Anthropic documentation.

## Configurations

### Arguments

The `args` field in the MCP server definition specifies the command-line arguments passed to the server when it starts. These arguments control how the server is executed and configured. For example:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aws.dp-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "awslabs.aws-dataprocessing-mcp-server@latest",
        "--allow-write",
        "--allow-sensitive-data-access"
      ],
      "env": {
        "AWS_PROFILE": "your-profile",
        "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### `awslabs.aws-dataprocessing-mcp-server@latest` (required)

Specifies the latest package/version specifier for the MCP client config.

* Enables MCP server startup and tool registration.

#### `--allow-write` (optional)

Enables write access mode, which allows mutating operations (e.g., create, update, delete resources)

* Default: false (The server runs in read-only mode by default)
* Example: Add `--allow-write` to the `args` list in your MCP server definition.

#### `--allow-sensitive-data-access` (optional)

Enables access to sensitive data such as logs, events, and Kubernetes Secrets.

* Default: false (Access to sensitive data is restricted by default)
* Example: Add `--allow-sensitive-data-access` to the `args` list in your MCP server definition.

### Environment variables

The `env` field in the MCP server definition allows you to configure environment variables that control the behavior of the DataProcessing MCP server.  For example:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aws.dp-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "awslabs.aws-dataprocessing-mcp-server@latest",
        "--allow-write",
        "--allow-sensitive-data-access"
      ],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR",
        "AWS_PROFILE": "my-profile",
        "AWS_REGION": "us-west-2",
        "CUSTOM_TAGS": "true"  // Skip adding and verifying MCP-managed tags
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### `FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL` (optional)

Sets the logging level verbosity for the server.

* Valid values: "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR", "CRITICAL"
* Default: "WARNING"
* Example: `"FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"`

#### `AWS_PROFILE` (optional)

Specifies the AWS profile to use for authentication.

* Default: None (If not set, uses default AWS credentials).
* Example: `"AWS_PROFILE": "my-profile"`

#### `AWS_REGION` (optional)

Specifies the AWS region where Glue,EMR clusters or Athena are managed, which will be used for all AWS service operations.

* Default: None (If not set, uses default AWS region).
* Example: `"AWS_REGION": "us-west-2"`

#### `CUSTOM_TAGS` (optional)

Controls whether the MCP server adds and verifies MCP-managed tags on resources.

* When set to 'true', the server will:
  * Skip adding default MCP tags to resources during creation
  * Skip verifying that resources have MCP-managed tags during operations
* Default: None (If not set, MCP tags are added and verified)
* Example: `"CUSTOM_TAGS": "true"`
* **Important**: Enabling this option means resources won't be tagged as MCP-managed. This is done at the owner's consent and responsibility, as it bypasses the built-in resource management safeguards.
