# AWS Knowledge MCP Server

A fully managed remote MCP server that provides up-to-date documentation, code samples, knowledge about the regional availability of AWS APIs and CloudFormation resources, and other official AWS content.

This MCP server is in general availability.

**Important Note**: Not all MCP clients today support remote servers. Please make sure that your client supports remote MCP servers or that you have a suitable proxy setup to use this server.

## Configuration

You can configure the Knowledge MCP server for use with any MCP client that supports Streamable HTTP transport (HTTP) using the following URL:

```url
https://knowledge-mcp.global.api.aws
```

**Note:** The specific configuration format varies by MCP client. Below is an example for [Kiro CLI](https://kiro.dev/). If you are using a different client, refer to your client's documentation on how to add remote MCP servers using the URL above.

**Kiro CLI**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aws-knowledge-mcp-server": {
      "url": "https://knowledge-mcp.global.api.aws",
      "type": "http",
      "disabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

If the client you are using does not support HTTP transport for MCP or if it encounters issues during setup, you can use the [fastmcp](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp) utility to proxy from stdio to HTTP transport. Below is a configuration example for the fastmcp utility.

**fastmcp**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aws-knowledge-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["fastmcp", "run", "https://knowledge-mcp.global.api.aws"]
    }
  }
}
```

### MCP Registries

The AWS Knowledge MCP Server is available in the following official MCP registries:

- [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@FaresYoussef94/aws-knowledge-mcp)
- [Cursor](https://cursor.directory/mcp/aws-knowledge-mcp-1)

We are actively working on onboarding to additional registries to make installation even easier.

### Testing and Troubleshooting

If you want to call the Knowledge MCP server directly, not through an LLM, you can use the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) tool. It provides you with a UI where you can execute `tools/list` and `tools/call` with arbitrary parameters.
You can use the following command to start MCP Inspector. It will output a URL that you can navigate to in your browser. If you are having trouble connecting to the server, ensure you click on the URL from the terminal because it contains a session token for using MCP Inspector.

```
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector https://knowledge-mcp.global.api.aws
```

### AWS Authentication

The Knowledge MCP server does not require authentication but is subject to rate limits.

### Data Usage

Telemetry data collected through AWS Knowledge MCP server is not used for machine learning model training or improvement purposes.
