This MCP server provides tools to access Amazon Location Service capabilities, focusing on place search and geographical coordinates.

## Features

- **Search for Places**: Search for places using geocoding
- **Get Place Details**: Get details for specific places by PlaceId
- **Reverse Geocode**: Convert coordinates to addresses
- **Search Nearby**: Search for places near a specified location
- **Open Now Search**: Search for places that are currently open
- **Route Calculation**: Calculate routes between locations using Amazon Location Service
- **Optimize Waypoints**: Optimize the order of waypoints for a route using Amazon Location Service

## Prerequisites

### Requirements

Here are the ways you can work with the Amazon Location MCP server:

## Configuration

Configure the server in your MCP configuration file. Here are some ways you can work with MCP across AWS, and we'll be adding support to more products soon: (e.g. for Kiro, `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "awslabs.aws-location-mcp-server": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": ["awslabs.aws-location-mcp-server@latest"],
        "env": {
          "AWS_PROFILE": "your-aws-profile",
          "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1",
          "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
        },
        "disabled": false,
        "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```
### Windows Installation

For Windows users, the MCP server configuration format is slightly different:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "awslabs.aws-location-mcp-server": {
      "disabled": false,
      "timeout": 60,
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "tool",
        "run",
        "--from",
        "awslabs.aws-location-mcp-server@latest",
        "awslabs.aws-location-mcp-server.exe"
      ],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR",
        "AWS_PROFILE": "your-aws-profile",
        "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```


### Using Temporary Credentials

For temporary credentials (such as those from AWS STS, IAM roles, or federation):


```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "awslabs.aws-location-mcp-server": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": ["awslabs.aws-location-mcp-server@latest"],
        "env": {
          "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "your-temporary-access-key",
          "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "your-temporary-secret-key",
          "AWS_SESSION_TOKEN": "your-session-token",
          "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1",
          "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
        },
        "disabled": false,
        "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Docker Configuration

After building with `docker build -t awslabs/aws-location-mcp-server .`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "awslabs.aws-location-mcp-server": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "--rm",
          "-i",
          "awslabs/aws-location-mcp-server"
        ],
        "env": {
          "AWS_PROFILE": "your-aws-profile",
          "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1"
        },
        "disabled": false,
        "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Docker with Temporary Credentials

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "awslabs.aws-location-mcp-server": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "--rm",
          "-i",
          "awslabs/aws-location-mcp-server"
        ],
        "env": {
          "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "your-temporary-access-key",
          "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "your-temporary-secret-key",
          "AWS_SESSION_TOKEN": "your-session-token",
          "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1"
        },
        "disabled": false,
        "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

- `AWS_PROFILE`: AWS CLI profile to use for credentials
- `AWS_REGION`: AWS region to use (default: us-east-1)
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Explicit AWS credentials (alternative to AWS_PROFILE)
- `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`: Session token for temporary credentials (used with AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)
- `FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level (ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG)

## Tools

The server exposes the following tools through the MCP interface:

### search_places

Search for places using Amazon Location Service geocoding capabilities.

```python
search_places(query: str, max_results: int = 5, mode: str = 'summary') -> dict
```

### get_place

Get details for a specific place using its unique place ID.

```python
get_place(place_id: str, mode: str = 'summary') -> dict
```

### reverse_geocode

Convert coordinates to an address using reverse geocoding.

```python
reverse_geocode(longitude: float, latitude: float) -> dict
```

### search_nearby

Search for places near a specific location with optional radius expansion.

```python
search_nearby(longitude: float, latitude: float, radius: int = 500, max_results: int = 5,
              query: str = None, max_radius: int = 10000, expansion_factor: float = 2.0,
              mode: str = 'summary') -> dict
```

### search_places_open_now

Search for places that are currently open, with radius expansion if needed.

```python
search_places_open_now(query: str, max_results: int = 5, initial_radius: int = 500,
                       max_radius: int = 50000, expansion_factor: float = 2.0) -> dict
```

### calculate_route

Calculate a route between two locations using Amazon Location Service.

```python
calculate_route(
    departure_position: list,  # [longitude, latitude]
    destination_position: list,  # [longitude, latitude]
    travel_mode: str = 'Car',  # 'Car', 'Truck', 'Walking', or 'Bicycle'
    optimize_for: str = 'FastestRoute'  # 'FastestRoute' or 'ShortestRoute'
) -> dict
```
Returns route geometry, distance, duration, and turn-by-turn directions.

- `departure_position`: List of [longitude, latitude] for the starting point.
- `destination_position`: List of [longitude, latitude] for the destination.
- `travel_mode`: Travel mode, one of `'Car'`, `'Truck'`, `'Walking'`, or `'Bicycle'`.
- `optimize_for`: Route optimization, either `'FastestRoute'` or `'ShortestRoute'`.

See [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/calculate-routes-custom-avoidance-shortest.html) for more details.

### geocode

Get coordinates for a location name or address.

```python
geocode(location: str) -> dict
```

### optimize_waypoints

Optimize the order of waypoints using Amazon Location Service geo-routes API.

```python
optimize_waypoints(
    origin_position: list,  # [longitude, latitude]
    destination_position: list,  # [longitude, latitude]
    waypoints: list,  # List of waypoints, each as a dict with at least Position [longitude, latitude]
    travel_mode: str = 'Car',
    mode: str = 'summary'
) -> dict
```
Returns the optimized order of waypoints, total distance, and duration.

## Amazon Location Service Resources

This server uses the Amazon Location Service geo-places and route calculation APIs for:
- Geocoding (converting addresses to coordinates)
- Reverse geocoding (converting coordinates to addresses)
- Place search (finding places by name, category, etc.)
- Place details (getting information about specific places)
- **Route calculation (finding routes between locations)**

## Security Considerations

- Use AWS profiles for credential management
- Use IAM policies to restrict access to only the required Amazon Location Service resources
- Use temporary credentials (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and AWS_SESSION_TOKEN) from AWS STS for enhanced security
- Implement AWS IAM roles with temporary credentials for applications and services
- Regularly rotate credentials and use the shortest practical expiration time for temporary credentials
