    """Locate an AWS Elastic Network Interface (ENI) by its IP address.

    Use this tool when:
    - Starting network troubleshooting to find where an IP address is located
    - Identifying which VPC, subnet, and security groups are associated with an IP
    - Determining the AWS resource (EC2, Lambda, RDS, etc.) using a specific IP
    - Beginning path trace analysis by locating source or destination endpoints

    The tool searches for both private and public IP addresses. If all_regions is False,
    it searches only the specified region. If all_regions is True, it searches all
    enabled regions in the account until the IP is found.

    Common workflow:
    1. Use this tool to locate the IP address
    2. Use get_eni_details() to analyze security groups and routing
    3. Use get_vpc_network_details() to understand VPC configuration
    4. Follow routing through Transit Gateway or Cloud WAN as needed

    Returns:
        Dict containing ENI details including:
        - NetworkInterfaceId: The ENI identifier
        - VpcId: The VPC where the ENI is located
        - SubnetId: The subnet where the ENI is located
        - PrivateIpAddress: The primary private IP
        - Association: Public IP details (if assigned)
        - Groups: Security groups attached to the ENI
        - Attachment: Information about attached resource (EC2, Lambda, etc.)
