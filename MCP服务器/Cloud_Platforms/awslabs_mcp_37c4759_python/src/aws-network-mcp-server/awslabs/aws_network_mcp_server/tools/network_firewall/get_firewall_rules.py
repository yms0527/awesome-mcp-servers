    """Get AWS Network Firewall rules for traffic inspection analysis.

    Retrieves comprehensive firewall rule configuration including both stateless and stateful rules.
    Use this tool to analyze firewall policies, troubleshoot traffic blocking, and verify security rules.

    ## When to Use
    - Investigating why traffic is being blocked or allowed through the firewall
    - Validating firewall rule configuration and priorities
    - Analyzing security posture of Network Firewall deployments
    - Troubleshooting connectivity issues involving AWS Network Firewall
    - Auditing firewall rules for compliance or security reviews

    ## Rule Types Returned
    1. **Stateless Rules**: Fast path rules evaluated by priority (lower = higher priority)
       - Match on basic packet headers (source/dest IP, ports, protocols)
       - Actions: PASS, DROP, FORWARD to stateful engine

    2. **Stateful Rules**: Deep packet inspection rules
       - Suricata format rules for complex pattern matching
       - 5-tuple rules (protocol, source/dest IP/port)
       - Domain list rules for DNS filtering

    ## Workflow Integration
    1. Use detect_tgw_inspection() or detect_cloudwan_inspection() to identify firewalls in path
    2. Call this tool to retrieve and analyze firewall rules
    3. Use get_network_firewall_flow_logs() to verify actual traffic behavior

    Returns:
        Dict containing:
        - firewall_name: Name of the firewall
        - summary: Rule counts by type
        - stateless_rules: List of stateless rules with priorities and actions
        - stateful_rules: List of stateful rules with match criteria and actions
