    """Detect AWS Network Firewalls and 3rd party firewalls attached to a Transit Gateway.

    Use this tool when:
    - Analyzing network security architecture and traffic inspection points
    - Troubleshooting connectivity issues that may involve firewall filtering
    - Validating that firewalls are properly attached to Transit Gateway for inspection
    - Planning network changes that could affect firewall traffic flow
    - Auditing security posture of Transit Gateway-based networks
    - Determining if traffic between specific segments will be inspected by firewalls

    This tool analyzes three types of firewall deployments:
    1. AWS Network Firewalls attached via VPC attachments
    2. AWS Network Firewalls attached via network-function attachments
    3. 3rd party firewalls behind Gateway Load Balancer endpoints

    Common troubleshooting scenarios:
    - "Why is traffic being blocked between two VPCs?"
    - "Is my traffic going through a firewall for inspection?"
    - "What firewalls are protecting my Transit Gateway traffic?"

    Returns:
        Dict containing inspection firewall details, traffic inspection status, and detailed
        analysis of which firewalls will process traffic through the Transit Gateway:
        - vpc_firewall_attachments: AWS Network Firewalls in VPCs attached to TGW
        - tgw_firewall_attachments: AWS Network Firewalls directly attached to TGW
        - gwlb_firewalls: 3rd party firewalls behind GWLB endpoints
        - has_firewalls: Boolean indicating if any firewalls were detected
        - total_firewalls: Total count of all detected firewalls
        - inspection_summary: Human-readable summary of findings
