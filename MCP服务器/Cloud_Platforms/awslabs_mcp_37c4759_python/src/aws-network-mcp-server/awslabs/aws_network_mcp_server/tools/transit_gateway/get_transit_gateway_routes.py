    """Get routes from a specific Transit Gateway route table with optional filtering.

    Use this tool when:
    - Analyzing routing paths through a Transit Gateway
    - Troubleshooting connectivity issues involving Transit Gateway routing
    - Verifying route propagation from VPC or VPN attachments
    - Identifying blackhole routes that may be blocking traffic
    - Comparing static vs propagated routes in a route table

    Prerequisites:
    - Transit Gateway must be registered to a Cloud WAN Global Network
    - Use list_transit_gateways() to discover Transit Gateway IDs
    - Use get_tgw_details() to find route table IDs

    Filters:
    - route_state: Filter by ACTIVE (working routes) or BLACKHOLE (failed routes)
    - route_type: Filter by PROPAGATED (automatic) or STATIC (manual) routes

    Returns:
    - Route destinations (CIDR blocks)
    - Attachment IDs where traffic is forwarded
    - Resource types (VPC, VPN, peering, etc.)
    - Route type and state for each entry
    - Total route count

    Common troubleshooting workflow:
    1. Use get_tgw_details() to list available route tables
    2. Call this tool with specific route_table_id
    3. Check for blackhole routes if connectivity fails
    4. Verify expected routes are present and active
