    """Detect Network Function Groups (NFGs) performing inspection in CloudWAN path.

    Use this tool when:
    - Analyzing CloudWAN traffic inspection and security architecture
    - Troubleshooting connectivity issues that may involve NFG-based firewall filtering
    - Validating that Network Function Groups are properly configured for traffic inspection
    - Planning CloudWAN policy changes that could affect firewall traffic flow
    - Auditing security posture of CloudWAN segment-to-segment communication
    - Determining if traffic between specific segments will be inspected by firewalls

    This tool analyzes the live CloudWAN policy document to identify Network Function Groups
    (NFGs) that are configured to inspect traffic flowing between specified source and
    destination segments. It examines segment-actions in the policy to find 'via' or
    'send-via' routing rules that force traffic through inspection NFGs.

    Returns:
        Dict containing inspection NFGs in path, traffic inspection status, and detailed
        analysis of which NFGs will process traffic between the specified segments
