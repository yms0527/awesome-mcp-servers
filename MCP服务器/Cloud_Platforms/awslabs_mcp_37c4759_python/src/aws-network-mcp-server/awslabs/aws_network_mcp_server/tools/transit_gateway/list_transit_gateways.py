    Use this tool when:
    - Starting network troubleshooting to discover available Transit Gateways
    - Planning network architecture changes across regions
    - Auditing Transit Gateway deployments
    - Finding Transit Gateway IDs for use with other tools like get_tgw_details()

    Workflow:
    1. Call this tool to discover Transit Gateways in a region
    2. Use get_tgw_details() with specific Transit Gateway ID for detailed information
    3. Use get_all_tgw_routes() or get_tgw_routes() to analyze routing
    4. Use detect_tgw_inspection() to identify firewall inspection points
