    Use this tool when:
    - Starting network troubleshooting to identify available firewalls
    - Discovering which Network Firewalls exist before analyzing rules or logs
    - Validating firewall deployment across regions
    - Getting firewall names/ARNs needed for other firewall tools

    WORKFLOW:
    1. Call this tool to discover available Network Firewalls
    2. Use get_firewall_rules() with firewall_name to analyze rules
    3. Use get_network_firewall_flow_logs() to examine traffic patterns

    RELATED TOOLS:
    - Use get_firewall_rules() to inspect firewall rule configurations
    - Use get_network_firewall_flow_logs() to analyze traffic through firewalls
    - Use detect_tgw_inspection() to identify firewalls attached to Transit Gateway

    Returns:
        Dict containing:
        - firewalls: List of firewall objects with name and ARN
        - region: AWS region queried
        - total_count: Number of firewalls found
