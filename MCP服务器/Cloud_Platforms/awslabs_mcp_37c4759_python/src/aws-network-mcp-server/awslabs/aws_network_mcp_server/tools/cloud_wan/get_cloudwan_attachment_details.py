    This method handles all Cloud WAN attachment types:
    - VPC attachments (includes subnet ARNs and VPC options)
    - Connect attachments (includes protocol options and transport attachment ID)
    - Direct Connect Gateway attachments (includes Direct Connect Gateway ARN)
    - Site-to-Site VPN attachments (includes VPN connection ARN)
    - Transit Gateway Route Table attachments (includes peering ID and route table ARN)

    Use cases:
    - Use this tool when you want to verify attachment details.
    - Validate that Cloud WAN attachment policy is working correctly.

    Returns comprehensive attachment details specific to each attachment type.
