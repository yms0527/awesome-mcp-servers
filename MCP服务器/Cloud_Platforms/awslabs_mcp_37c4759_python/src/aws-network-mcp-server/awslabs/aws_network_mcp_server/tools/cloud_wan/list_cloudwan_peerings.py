    Use this tool when:
    - Investigating connectivity between Cloud WAN and Transit Gateways
    - Troubleshooting cross-region or cross-account network connectivity
    - Validating peering configurations and states
    - Mapping network topology between Cloud WAN and Transit Gateway environments
    - Analyzing hybrid network architectures

    WORKFLOW CONTEXT:
    - Use after get_cloudwan_details() to understand core network structure
    - Use before get_cloudwan_peering_details() to identify specific peering IDs
    - Combine with list_tgw_peerings() for complete peering visibility

    Returns:
        List of Transit Gateway peering dictionaries containing:
        - PeeringId: Unique identifier for the peering
        - CoreNetworkId: Source Cloud WAN core network ID
        - TransitGatewayArn: Target Transit Gateway ARN
        - State: Peering state (CREATING, AVAILABLE, DELETING, etc.)
        - EdgeLocation: AWS region where peering exists
        - ResourceArn: Full ARN of the peering resource
        - Tags: Associated resource tags
