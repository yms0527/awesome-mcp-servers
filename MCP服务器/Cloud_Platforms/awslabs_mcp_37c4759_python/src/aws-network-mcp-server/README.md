## Prerequisites
- Have an AWS account with [credentials configured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)
- Install uv from [Astral](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) or the [GitHub README](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation)
- Install Python 3.10 or newer using uv python install 3.10 (or a more recent version)
- This MCP server can only be run locally on the same host as your LLM client.

## Configuration

You can download the AWS Network MCP Server from GitHub. To get started using your favorite code assistant with MCP support, like Kiro, Cursor, or Cline.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "awslabs.aws-network-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "awslabs.aws-network-mcp-server@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "AWS_PROFILE": "your-aws-profile",
        "AWS_REGION": "us-west-2"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Windows Installation

For Windows users, the MCP server configuration format is slightly different:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "awslabs.aws-network-mcp-server": {
      "disabled": false,
      "timeout": 60,
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "tool",
        "run",
        "--from",
        "awslabs.aws-network-mcp-server@latest",
        "awslabs.aws-network-mcp-server.exe"
      ],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR",
        "AWS_PROFILE": "your-aws-profile",
        "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### AWS Authentication

Preferred authentication method is [AWS Named Profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html). This MCP is able to do fast account switching by using named profiles.

AWS Credentials in environment variables will also work but allows only single account usage.

```

#### Multi-Account Access

Use the `profile_name` parameter in tools to specify different AWS CLI profiles for cross-account access. Some tools support separate profiles for different resources (e.g., `tgw_account_profile_name` and `cloudwan_account_profile_name`).

### Data Usage

This MCP server operates entirely locally and makes direct API calls to AWS services. No data is sent to third-party services. All AWS API calls are subject to AWS service terms and your organization's AWS policies.

### FAQs

#### 1. Do I need an AWS account?

Yes. This server makes API calls to AWS services and requires valid AWS credentials with appropriate IAM permissions.

#### 2. What AWS regions are supported?

All AWS commercial regions are supported. Tools that support multi-region search (like `find_ip_address`) can search across all enabled regions in your account.

#### 3. Why do some tools require Network Manager registration?

Transit Gateway route tools (`get_tgw_routes`, `get_all_tgw_routes`) require the Transit Gateway to be registered with AWS Network Manager (Cloud WAN Global Network). This is an AWS requirement for accessing route table information via the Network Manager API.

#### 4. Do flow log tools work without CloudWatch Logs?

No. Flow log tools (`get_vpc_flow_logs`, `get_tgw_flow_logs`, `get_network_firewall_flow_logs`) require that flow logging is enabled and configured to send logs to CloudWatch Logs (not S3 or Kinesis Data Firehose).

#### 5. Can this server make changes to my AWS infrastructure?

No. All tools are read-only and only perform Describe, Get, and List operations. The server cannot create, modify, or delete any AWS resources.

#### 6. How do I troubleshoot "No flow logs found" errors?

Verify that:
- Flow logging is enabled on the resource (VPC, Transit Gateway, or Network Firewall)
- Logs are configured to send to CloudWatch Logs
- The time range includes periods when traffic was flowing
- Your IAM permissions include `logs:FilterLogEvents`
