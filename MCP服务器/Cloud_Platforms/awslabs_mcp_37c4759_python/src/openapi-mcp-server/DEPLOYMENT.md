# Deployment Guide for OpenAPI MCP Server

[← Back to main README](README.md)

This document provides guidance on deploying the OpenAPI MCP Server in various environments, with a focus on AWS deployment options and considerations for the Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport.

## Building and Deploying with Docker

The project includes a Dockerfile that sets up the environment for running the OpenAPI MCP Server.

### Building the Docker Image

Navigate to the project directory and build the Docker image:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /path/to/openapi-mcp-server

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t openapi-mcp-server:latest .
```

### Running the Container Locally

Once the image is built, you can run it locally:

```bash
# Run with Petstore API example
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  -e API_NAME=petstore \
  -e API_BASE_URL=https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3 \
  -e API_SPEC_URL=https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json \
  openapi-mcp-server:latest

# Run with custom API configuration
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  -e API_NAME=myapi \
  -e API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com \
  -e API_SPEC_URL=https://api.example.com/openapi.json \
  -e SERVER_TRANSPORT=sse \
  -e ENABLE_PROMETHEUS=false \
  -e ENABLE_OPERATION_PROMPTS=true \
  openapi-mcp-server:latest
```

### Environment Variables for Docker

You can customize the container behavior using environment variables:

```bash
# Server configuration
-e SERVER_NAME="My API Server" \
-e SERVER_DEBUG=true \
-e SERVER_MESSAGE_TIMEOUT=60 \
-e SERVER_HOST="0.0.0.0" \
-e SERVER_PORT=8000 \
-e SERVER_TRANSPORT="sse" \
-e LOG_LEVEL="INFO" \

# API configuration
-e API_NAME="myapi" \
-e API_BASE_URL="https://api.example.com" \
-e API_SPEC_URL="https://api.example.com/openapi.json" \

# Authentication configuration
-e AUTH_TYPE="api_key" \
-e AUTH_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY" \
-e AUTH_API_KEY_NAME="X-API-Key" \
-e AUTH_API_KEY_IN="header" \

# Prometheus configuration
-e ENABLE_PROMETHEUS=false \
-e PROMETHEUS_PORT=9090 \
-e ENABLE_OPERATION_PROMPTS=true
```

### Graceful Shutdown

The OpenAPI MCP Server implements a robust graceful shutdown mechanism to ensure clean termination when the server is stopped or interrupted. This is particularly important for production deployments where abrupt termination could lead to connection errors, data loss, or incomplete operations.

#### How Graceful Shutdown Works

When the server receives a termination signal (SIGINT from Ctrl+C or SIGTERM from container orchestrators):

1. The server logs that it's shutting down gracefully
2. Final metrics are logged to provide visibility into the server's state at shutdown
3. For SIGINT (Ctrl+C), the server chains to the original handler after logging
4. Uvicorn's built-in graceful shutdown process handles the actual shutdown
5. Active connections are allowed to complete before the server exits

#### Configuration Options

The server's graceful shutdown can be configured through uvicorn options:

```bash
# Set a custom timeout for graceful shutdown (in seconds)
-e UVICORN_TIMEOUT_GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN=5.0

# Enable/disable graceful shutdown (default: true)
-e UVICORN_GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN=true
```

#### Best Practices for Container Environments

When running in container environments like Docker, Kubernetes, or ECS:

1. **Set appropriate termination grace periods** - Allow enough time for connections to complete
2. **Use SIGTERM for orchestrated shutdowns** - Container orchestrators typically send SIGTERM
3. **Configure health checks** - Ensure they fail appropriately during shutdown
4. **Monitor shutdown metrics** - Track shutdown times and any errors during shutdown

### Deploying to AWS

#### Push to Amazon ECR

```bash
# Authenticate with ECR
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

# Create ECR repository (if it doesn't exist)
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name openapi-mcp-server

# Tag and push the image
docker tag openapi-mcp-server:latest YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/openapi-mcp-server:latest
docker push YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/openapi-mcp-server:latest
```

#### Health Checks and Monitoring

The Docker container includes a health check script. You can monitor the container health with:

```bash
# Check container health
docker inspect --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}' container_id

# View container logs
docker logs container_id
```

#### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check container logs: `docker logs container_id`
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure the API specification URL is accessible from within the container
4. Check that the port mapping is correct (-p 8000:8000)
5. Verify network connectivity for external API access

## SSE Transport Considerations

### Important Notes on Transport Compatibility

- **SSE (Server-Sent Events)** is supported by the Model Context Protocol but not by AWS Lambda
- **WebSocket** is not yet supported by the Model Context Protocol
- **stdio** transport is supported for local development but not suitable for web deployments

### Using SSE with Amazon EKS

When deploying to Amazon EKS, SSE works well because containers can maintain persistent connections:

1. **Configure your EKS deployment** to use the SSE transport:

```yaml
# openapi-mcp-server-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: openapi-mcp-server
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: openapi-mcp-server
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: openapi-mcp-server
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: openapi-mcp-server
        image: YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/openapi-mcp-server:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8000
        env:
        - name: SERVER_TRANSPORT
          value: "sse"  # Explicitly set SSE transport
        - name: API_NAME
          value: "myapi"
        - name: API_BASE_URL
          value: "https://api.example.com"
        - name: API_SPEC_URL
          value: "https://api.example.com/openapi.json"
```

2. **Ensure your ingress controller** is configured to support SSE connections:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: openapi-mcp-server-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout: "3600"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-send-timeout: "3600"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-buffering: "off"
spec:
  rules:
  - host: api.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: openapi-mcp-server
            port:
              number: 80
```

### API Gateway with SSE - Challenges and Solutions

API Gateway has limitations with SSE due to its timeout constraints:

1. **API Gateway HTTP APIs** have a maximum timeout of 29 seconds, which is insufficient for long-running SSE connections
2. **API Gateway REST APIs** have similar timeout limitations

#### Recommended Architecture for API Gateway

For production deployments requiring SSE with API Gateway:

1. **Use Amazon EKS or ECS** to host the OpenAPI MCP Server
2. **Place an Application Load Balancer (ALB)** in front of your EKS/ECS service
3. **Configure the ALB** with appropriate idle timeout settings (up to 4000 seconds)
4. **Use API Gateway** only for initial connection establishment and authentication
5. **Redirect clients** to the ALB endpoint for the actual SSE connection

```
Client → API Gateway (auth/initial connection) → Redirect → ALB → OpenAPI MCP Server (EKS/ECS)
```

### Best Practice for Production Deployment with SSE

For the most reliable SSE implementation with AWS services:

1. **Deploy on Amazon ECS with Fargate** for containerized deployment with auto-scaling
2. **Use an Application Load Balancer** with idle timeout set to at least 120 seconds
3. **Implement health checks** to ensure container availability
4. **Set up CloudWatch alarms** to monitor connection counts and response times
5. **Use AWS X-Ray** for tracing requests through your application
6. **Implement Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus** for metrics collection and monitoring

This approach provides the most reliable support for SSE connections while still leveraging AWS managed services and maintaining compatibility with the Model Context Protocol.

## Observability with AWS Services

### AWS X-Ray for Distributed Tracing

AWS X-Ray provides end-to-end tracing capabilities that help you analyze and debug distributed applications:

1. **Enable X-Ray in your application**:
   ```python
   # Install the X-Ray SDK
   pip install aws-xray-sdk

   # Add X-Ray middleware to your application
   from aws_xray_sdk.core import xray_recorder
   from aws_xray_sdk.ext.flask.middleware import XRayMiddleware

   xray_recorder.configure(service='openapi-mcp-server')
   XRayMiddleware(app, xray_recorder)
   ```

2. **Configure X-Ray daemon** in your container:
   ```yaml
   # Add X-Ray daemon as a sidecar container
   - name: xray-daemon
     image: amazon/aws-xray-daemon
     ports:
       - containerPort: 2000
         protocol: UDP
   ```

3. **Set up IAM permissions** for X-Ray:
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "xray:PutTraceSegments",
           "xray:PutTelemetryRecords"
         ],
         "Resource": "*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

### Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus

For comprehensive metrics collection and monitoring, integrate with Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus:

1. **Configure Prometheus in your application**:
   ```python
   # Set environment variables
   ENABLE_PROMETHEUS=true
   PROMETHEUS_PORT=9090
   ```

2. **Set up remote write to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus**:
   ```yaml
   # prometheus.yml
   global:
     scrape_interval: 15s

   remote_write:
     - url: https://aps-workspaces.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/workspaces/ws-12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012/api/v1/remote_write
       sigv4:
         region: us-east-1
       queue_config:
         max_samples_per_send: 1000
         max_shards: 200

   scrape_configs:
     - job_name: 'openapi-mcp-server'
       static_configs:
         - targets: ['localhost:9090']
   ```

3. **Create an IAM role** with permissions for Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus:
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "aps:RemoteWrite",
           "aps:GetSeries",
           "aps:GetLabels",
           "aps:GetMetricMetadata"
         ],
         "Resource": "*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

4. **Visualize metrics** using Amazon Managed Grafana:
   - Create a Grafana workspace in the AWS console
   - Add Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus as a data source
   - Import or create dashboards for monitoring your OpenAPI MCP Server

This comprehensive observability setup provides both tracing and metrics monitoring for your OpenAPI MCP Server deployment.
