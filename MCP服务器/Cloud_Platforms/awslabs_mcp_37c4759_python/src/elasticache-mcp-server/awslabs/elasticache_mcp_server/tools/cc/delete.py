    This tool deletes an existing cache cluster. Optionally, it can create a final
    snapshot of the cluster before deletion.

    Parameters:
        cache_cluster_id (str): The ID of the cache cluster to delete.

            cache cluster snapshot. This is the unique name that identifies the
            snapshot. ElastiCache creates the snapshot, and then deletes the cache
            cluster immediately afterward.
