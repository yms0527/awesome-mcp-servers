Follow these steps:
1. Use compute_optimizer_get_ec2_instance_recommendations to retrieve instance recommendations
2. Filter the results to find instances with Graviton alternatives (look for m6g, c6g, r6g, etc. in recommendationOptions)
3. For each candidate instance:
   - Look at the potential monthly and annual savings
   - Assess migration complexity based on instance type and usage patterns
   - Note any compatibility considerations
4. Summarize the findings with:
   - Total number of instances that could benefit from Graviton migration
   - Total potential monthly and annual savings
   - Instances grouped by migration complexity (Easy, Medium, Complex)
   - Top 5 instances with highest savings potential

Present the results in a clear, actionable format with tables where appropriate."""
