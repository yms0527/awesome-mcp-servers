    """Tool for listing imported models in Amazon Bedrock.

    This class implements the list_imported_models tool which allows users to
    retrieve a list of all models that have been imported into Amazon Bedrock.
    It supports filtering and sorting options to help users find specific models
    or organize the results according to their needs.

    The tool provides a paginated list of models with their basic details. Users can
    filter models by creation time, name patterns, and other criteria. Results can be
    sorted by various attributes to help locate specific models or understand the
    chronological order of imports.

    Attributes:
        mcp: The FastMCP instance to register the tool with
        imported_model_service: The service for managing imported model operations
    """

        This tool retrieves a list of models that have already been imported into Amazon Bedrock.
        The results can be filtered and sorted using the optional request parameters.

        ## Usage Instructions
        1. Call this tool without parameters to list all imported models
        2. Optionally provide filtering parameters in the request:
           - creationTimeAfter: Filter models created after this time
           - creationTimeBefore: Filter models created before this time
           - nameContains: Filter models by name substring
           - sortBy: Sort results by field (e.g., CreationTime)
           - sortOrder: Sort order (Ascending, Descending)

        ## Information Returned
        - Model name and ARN
        - Creation time
        - Model architecture
        - Whether the model supports instruction tuning (✅ or ❌)

        ## How to Use This Information
        - Note model names for use with other tools like get_imported_model
        - Check instruction support to determine if models can be used for chat applications
        - Review model architectures to understand model capabilities

        ## When to Use
        - Before using get_imported_model to find the exact model name
        - When you need to see all available models in your account
        - To check if a specific model exists by filtering with nameContains
        - To find the most recently imported models by sorting by creation time
