```

### Environment Variables

| Variable        | Description                               | Default |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------- |
| LOG_LEVEL       | Logging verbosity (debug/info/warn/error) | info    |

## Verifying Installation

To verify your installation is working correctly:

1. Start the server in STDIO mode:

```bash

```

2. The server should start without errors and be ready to accept commands.

3. Test a basic command (in another terminal):

```bash
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"get_latest_block","params":{},"id":1}' | nc localhost 3000
```

You should receive a JSON response with the latest block information.
