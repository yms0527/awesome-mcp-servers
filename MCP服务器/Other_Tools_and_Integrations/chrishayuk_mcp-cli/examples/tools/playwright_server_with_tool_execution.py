"""
Complete end-to-end example with Playwright MCP server including tool execution.

This script demonstrates:
1. Adding the Playwright MCP server
2. Restarting the tool manager to connect
3. Listing available Playwright tools
4. Executing a Playwright tool (navigate to a webpage)
5. Removing the server

This proves the entire lifecycle including actual tool usage.
