"""AI Virtual Memory: End-to-End Memory Management Demo

Proves that the VM subsystem correctly enforces token budgets, triggers
eviction under pressure, and tracks pages across tiers.

Demonstrates:
  1. Budget enforcement — TokenBudget.total_limit syncs from WorkingSetConfig
  2. Page creation and L0 admission
  3. Eviction under pressure — pages evicted when budget exceeded
  4. Turn advancement — turn counter increments for recency tracking
  5. VM context building — developer_message reflects L0 contents only
  6. Event filtering — _vm_filter_events respects budget for raw events

No API keys or MCP servers required — runs fully self-contained.
