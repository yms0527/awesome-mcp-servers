# Architecture

High-level overview of how the Temporal Cortex MCP server works.

## Overview

The MCP server is a single Rust binary that communicates with AI clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf) over **stdio** or **streamable HTTP**. It runs locally on your machine.

```

│  Cursor, etc.)  │                └─────────────────┘              └──────────────┘
└─────────────────┘
```

## Tool Layers

Up to 18 tools are organized into 5 layers. The 15 core tools are always available; 3 additional Open Scheduling tools are available in Platform Mode. Agents work top-down: discover users, orient in time, then query calendars, then book.

```
Layer 4: Booking          [book_slot, request_booking*]                      — Safe mutation
Layer 3: Availability     [get_availability, query_public_availability*]     — Cross-calendar query
Layer 2: Calendar Ops     [list_calendars, list_events, find_free_slots,     — Calendar data
                           expand_rrule, check_availability]
Layer 1: Temporal Context  [get_temporal_context, resolve_datetime,            — Time awareness
                            convert_timezone, compute_duration,
                            adjust_timestamp]
Layer 0: Discovery        [resolve_identity*]                                — Identity resolution

* Platform Mode only
```

### Typical Agent Workflow

```
1. get_temporal_context           → "It's Friday 2:30 PM EST, DST inactive"
2. resolve_datetime("next Tue     → "2026-02-24T14:00:00-05:00"
   at 2pm")
3. find_free_slots(start, end)   → [14:00-15:00, 16:00-17:00]
4. book_slot(start, end, title)  → Lock → Verify → Write → Done
```

### Layer 1 — Temporal Context

AI agents call `get_temporal_context` first to learn the current time, timezone, UTC offset, and DST status. Then `resolve_datetime` converts human expressions like `"next Tuesday at 2pm"` into precise RFC 3339 timestamps that Layer 2-4 tools accept.

Layer 1 tools are pure computation — no calendar API calls, no network. They use the OS clock (`chrono::Utc::now()`) and the `chrono-tz` crate for timezone handling.

### Timezone Resolution

Timezone is resolved in this order (first match wins):

1. **Tool parameter** — explicit `timezone` on the API call
2. **`TIMEZONE` env var** — session-level override
3. **Config file** — `~/.config/temporal-cortex/config.json` (set during `cortex-mcp auth`)
4. **OS detection** — `iana-time-zone` crate reads the system timezone
5. **Error** — never silently falls back to UTC

## Distribution

The binary is distributed via npm as `@temporal-cortex/cortex-mcp`. When you run `npx @temporal-cortex/cortex-mcp`, npm downloads the correct platform-specific binary (macOS ARM64/x64, Linux x64/ARM64, Windows x64) via optional dependencies.

This means no Rust toolchain is required — `npx` handles everything.

### Docker

A Docker image is also available for containerized deployments and CI pipelines:

```bash
docker build -t cortex-mcp https://github.com/temporal-cortex/mcp.git
docker run --rm -i cortex-mcp
```

The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build: the first stage installs the npm package to extract the platform binary, and the final image is a minimal Debian Trixie slim with just the binary and CA certificates. No Node.js runtime is included in the final image.

## Key Components

### Truth Engine

Handles all date and time computation deterministically:

- **Temporal resolution**: Converts human expressions (`"next Tuesday at 2pm"`, `"tomorrow morning"`, `"+2h"`) into precise RFC 3339 timestamps. 60+ expression patterns supported.
- **Timezone conversion**: DST-aware conversion between IANA timezones with offset and DST status reporting.
- **Duration computation**: Precise duration between two timestamps with days/hours/minutes breakdown.
- **Timestamp adjustment**: DST-aware adjustment (`"+1d"` across spring-forward = same wall-clock, not +24 hours).
- **RRULE expansion**: Converts recurrence rules (RFC 5545) into concrete event instances. Handles DST transitions, `BYSETPOS`, `EXDATE`, leap years, and cross-year boundaries correctly.
- **Availability merging**: Combines events from multiple calendars into a unified busy/free view with configurable privacy controls.
- **Conflict detection**: Determines whether a proposed time slot overlaps with existing events.

Truth Engine is open source and available as a standalone library: [truth-engine on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/truth-engine), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@temporal-cortex/truth-engine), and [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/temporal-cortex-toon/). 510+ Rust tests, ~9,000 property-based tests.

### TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation)

A data format designed for LLM consumption. Calendar data encoded in TOON uses approximately 40% fewer tokens than equivalent JSON, reducing API costs and freeing context window space for the conversation.

TOON roundtrips perfectly — encode to TOON, decode back to the original data structure with zero loss. TOON is the default output format for all data tools (`list_calendars`, `list_events`, `find_free_slots`, `expand_rrule`, `get_availability`). Use `format: "json"` when you need structured JSON.

### Two-Phase Commit (Booking Safety)

When `book_slot` is called, the server follows a strict protocol:

1. **Prepare**: Acquire an exclusive lock on the time slot. Check the shadow calendar for any overlapping events or active holds.
2. **Commit**: If the slot is free, create the event in Google Calendar and record it in the shadow calendar.
3. **Abort**: If any step fails (lock acquisition, conflict detected, API error), release the lock and return an error.

This prevents double-booking even when multiple AI agents attempt to book the same time slot simultaneously.

### Content Sanitization

All user-provided text (event summaries, descriptions) passes through a prompt injection firewall before reaching the calendar API. This prevents malicious content from being written to the calendar via AI agents.

## Operating Modes

The server operates in two modes, auto-detected at startup:

### Local Mode (Default)

Activated when `REDIS_URLS` is **not** set.

- **Locking**: In-memory lock manager (single-process safety)
- **Credentials**: Local file store at `~/.config/temporal-cortex/credentials.json`
- **Provider**: Google Calendar (single account)
- **Use case**: Individual developers, local AI assistants

### Platform Mode

Activated when `DATABASE_URL` **is** set (managed service at mcp.temporal-cortex.com).

- **Locking**: Redis-based distributed locking (Redlock algorithm with 3-node quorum)
- **Credentials**: PostgresCredentialStore with managed OAuth lifecycle
- **Authentication**: Bearer token authentication via API keys
- **Provider**: Multiple providers and accounts
- **Use case**: Production deployments, multi-agent environments, teams

There is no manual mode flag — the server inspects the environment and selects the appropriate mode automatically.

## Transport Modes

The server supports two MCP transports, auto-detected at startup:

### Stdio (Default)

Standard MCP transport. The server reads JSON-RPC requests from stdin and writes responses to stdout. All logging goes to stderr to avoid interfering with the protocol transport.

### Streamable HTTP (when `HTTP_PORT` is set)

Per MCP 2025-11-25 spec. The server listens on `http://{HTTP_HOST}:{HTTP_PORT}/mcp` with SSE streaming, session management (`Mcp-Session-Id` header), and Origin validation. Requests with an invalid `Origin` header are rejected with HTTP 403.

## MCP Protocol

The server implements the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) specification using the rmcp Rust crate. It registers up to 18 tools with JSON Schema parameter definitions that MCP clients use for tool calling. In Local Mode, 15 core tools are registered. In Platform Mode, 3 additional Open Scheduling tools (`resolve_identity`, `query_public_availability`, `request_booking`) are conditionally registered, bringing the total to 18.
