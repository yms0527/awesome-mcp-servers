# Experiment Prompts

Each prompt has two versions: one for DOMShell (Method A) and one for Claude in Chrome (Method B). Copy-paste exactly — the guardrail preamble is intentional.

## How to Use

1. Open a **new Cowork session** in Claude Desktop (clean context — no carryover)
2. Copy the exact prompt block for the trial you're running
3. Paste it into the Cowork chat and let the agent work — **do not intervene**
4. When the agent produces its final answer, count tool calls and score against `results/ground_truth.md`

For the **shortcut method** (all 6 trials of one method in a single session), paste each prompt sequentially. Warm trials benefit from conversation context — note this in your methodology.

---

## Shared Preamble (baked into every prompt)

The preamble below is already included in each prompt. Do NOT modify it.

**Purpose of the preamble:**
- "Do not use prior knowledge" → forces the agent to actually read from the page, not recite from training data
- "If you cannot find an element after 3 attempts, skip it" → prevents infinite retry loops on gnarly DOM
- "Do not explore beyond what is needed" → stops the agent from doing a full page audit when we only need specific items
- "Return partial results if you run out of time" → ensures we always get scoreable output

- If you are still working after 15 tool calls, wrap up with whatever you have.
- Return partial results rather than nothing.
- When done, close all tabs you opened during this task to keep the browser clean for the next task.

TASK:
Navigate to https://www.time.gov/

1. Use javascript_exec to discover what callable functions are defined on window
   (not standard browser APIs). List them all.
   HINT: Create a hidden iframe to get the default window properties, then diff
   against the current window: Object.getOwnPropertyNames(window).filter(k =>
   typeof window[k] === 'function' && !defaultKeys.has(k))

2. Call checkTime(5) via javascript_exec and report the returned value.

3. Read the current time displayed on the page (find the element with id "myTime").

4. Read the time again after a short wait. Report the before and after values.
   HINT: Top-level await is NOT supported in javascript_exec. Use a Promise wrapper:
   new Promise(resolve => {
     const before = document.getElementById('myTime').textContent.trim();
     setTimeout(() => {
       const after = document.getElementById('myTime').textContent.trim();
       resolve(JSON.stringify({ before, after }));
     }, 2000);
   })

5. Read the UTC time (element with id "timeUTC") and compare it to the local time.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
## Discovered Functions
- function1()
- function2(args)
...

## Function Calls
- checkTime(5): [value]

## Current Time
- Local time (#myTime): [value]
- UTC time (#timeUTC): [value]
- Offset: [difference]

## Change Detection
- Before: [value]
- After: [value]
```

## Task 10: Search Pipeline with Replay

### Trial 27: Task 10 — DOMShell

```
RULES — read these first:
- You MUST use domshell MCP tools exclusively. No other browser tools.
- You MUST actually navigate to each page and read its content using your tools.
  Do NOT use prior knowledge or training data to answer.
- If you cannot find an element after 3 attempts, skip it as "[not found]".
- Do not explore the page beyond what is needed for the task.
- Be fast and direct. Minimize unnecessary tool calls.
- If you are still working after 20 tool calls, wrap up with whatever you have.
- Return partial results rather than nothing.
- When done, close all tabs you opened during this task to keep the browser clean for the next task.

HINT: Save a 2-command script using direct URL navigation (faster than open+submit):
  script save wiki_direct navigate https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/$1 ; eval document.querySelector('.mw-parser-output > p:not(.mw-empty-elt)').textContent
Then use "for" to run it for each article using underscore-separated slugs:
  for "eval ['Artificial_intelligence','Machine_learning','Deep_learning'].join('\n')" : script run wiki_direct "{}"
NOTE: Use underscore slugs (Artificial_intelligence) not spaces — direct URL
navigation avoids the search form entirely and is faster inside "for" loops.

TASK:
Search Wikipedia for 3 different topics: "Artificial intelligence", "Machine learning",
and "Deep learning". For each, extract the first sentence of the resulting article.

Do this efficiently by:
1. Saving a reusable search-and-extract script with variable substitution ($1)
2. Running the script for all 3 terms using a loop

Compare the first sentences and identify what they have in common.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
## Search Results
1. **Artificial intelligence**: first sentence
2. **Machine learning**: first sentence
3. **Deep learning**: first sentence

## Comparison
(what the 3 topics have in common based on their first sentences)
```

### Trial 28: Task 10 — Claude in Chrome

```
RULES — read these first:
- You MUST use your browser tools (navigate, read_page, find, get_page_text, form_input, etc.) to complete this task. Do NOT use domshell or any external MCP tools.
- You MUST actually navigate to each page and read its content using your tools.
  Do NOT use prior knowledge or training data to answer.
- If you cannot find an element after 3 attempts, skip it as "[not found]".
- Do not explore the page beyond what is needed for the task.
- Be fast and direct. Minimize unnecessary tool calls.
- If you are still working after 20 tool calls, wrap up with whatever you have.
- Return partial results rather than nothing.
- When done, close all tabs you opened during this task to keep the browser clean for the next task.

TASK:
Search Wikipedia for 3 different topics: "Artificial intelligence", "Machine learning",
and "Deep learning". For each, go to wikipedia.org, search using the search box,
click the first result, and extract the first sentence of the article.

Compare the first sentences and identify what they have in common.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
## Search Results
1. **Artificial intelligence**: first sentence
2. **Machine learning**: first sentence
3. **Deep learning**: first sentence

## Comparison
(what the 3 topics have in common based on their first sentences)
