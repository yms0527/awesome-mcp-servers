# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

Report vulnerabilities through:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories (preferred):** [Create a private security advisory](https://github.com/ofershap/real-browser-mcp/security/advisories/new)

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce or a minimal proof of concept
- The version(s) affected

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment** within 48 hours
- **Status update** within 7 days
- **Credit** in the release notes (unless you prefer to stay anonymous)

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| Latest  | Yes |

## Security Model

- **Local-only communication**: WebSocket between extension and server runs on localhost only
- **Origin validation**: Server rejects connections from non-extension origins
- **No data exfiltration**: Nothing leaves your machine. No cloud, no telemetry, no analytics
- **Minimal permissions**: Extension requests only the Chrome permissions it needs
- **Strict TypeScript**: Compiled with strict mode to reduce runtime errors

## Scope

In-scope:
- WebSocket security issues (authentication bypass, injection)
- Chrome extension permission escalation
- Data leakage through the MCP protocol
- Dependency vulnerabilities with a realistic exploit path

Out of scope:
- Issues in Chrome itself or the MCP SDK
- Denial of service via local WebSocket flooding
- Social engineering attacks
