 * Note: Sampling in MCP is initiated BY the server TO the client.
 * The server sends sampling/createMessage requests to ask the client
 * for LLM completions. This is useful for intelligent browser automation
 * where the server needs AI assistance to analyze pages and make decisions.
 *
 * Currently, sampling support depends on the MCP client implementation.
 * Not all clients support sampling yet. (ie claude desktop)
