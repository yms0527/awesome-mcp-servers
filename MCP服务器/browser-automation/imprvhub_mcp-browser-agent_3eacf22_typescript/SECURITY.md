## Prohibited Uses and Security Warnings

The MCP Browser Agent is a powerful tool that provides Claude with autonomous browser control capabilities. Due to its nature, there are significant security implications to be aware of:

### Prohibited Uses

The MCP Browser Agent must NOT be used for:

- **Unauthorized Data Collection**: Scraping data from websites without permission or in violation of terms of service.
- **Privacy Invasion**: Capturing screenshots or data containing personal information without proper consent.
- **Security Exploitation**: Executing malicious code, performing XSS attacks, or exploiting vulnerabilities.
- **Automated Abuse**: Credential stuffing, brute force attacks, spam creation, or DDoS attacks.

### Security Implications

Users should be aware of the following security implications:

2. **Credential Security**: Any credentials used within the browser session could potentially be exposed through logs or screenshots.
3. **Network Exposure**: The agent can make HTTP requests to any endpoint, potentially accessing internal network resources.
4. **Resource Consumption**: Automated browsing can consume significant system resources, especially with multiple concurrent sessions.
5. **Data Leakage**: Screenshots and logs may contain sensitive information that should be handled securely.

### Security Best Practices

To mitigate these risks:

- Use the agent in an isolated environment whenever possible.
- Never expose the agent to untrusted inputs or instructions.
- Regularly review browser logs and screenshots to monitor usage.
- Do not use the agent with sensitive accounts or on networks containing sensitive information.
- Limit the agent's access to specific domains when possible.
- Treat the browser instance as potentially compromised - do not use it for personal or sensitive activities.
