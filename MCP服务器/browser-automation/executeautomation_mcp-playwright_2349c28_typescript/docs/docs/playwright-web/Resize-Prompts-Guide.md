## 🎯 Responsive Testing Workflows

### Progressive Testing (Mobile to Desktop)

**AI Prompt:**
```
Test this page's responsiveness:
1. Start with mobile (iPhone 13)
2. Then tablet (iPad Pro 11)
3. Finally desktop (Desktop Chrome)

Take screenshots at each size and check if the layout looks correct.
```

**What the AI will do:**
```javascript
// The AI executes:
await playwright_navigate({ url: "https://example.com" });
await playwright_resize({ device: "iPhone 13" });
await playwright_screenshot({ name: "mobile-view" });

await playwright_resize({ device: "iPad Pro 11" });
await playwright_screenshot({ name: "tablet-view" });

await playwright_resize({ device: "Desktop Chrome" });
await playwright_screenshot({ name: "desktop-view" });
```

### Cross-Device Comparison

**AI Prompt:**
```
Compare how the navigation menu looks on:
- iPhone 13
- iPad Pro 11  
- Desktop Chrome

Take screenshots and tell me if there are any layout issues.
```

### Orientation Testing

**AI Prompt:**
```
Test the page in both portrait and landscape on iPhone 14:
1. Portrait mode first
2. Then landscape mode
Check if content reflows properly.
```

## 🔄 Context-Aware Prompts

### After Navigation

**AI Prompt:**
```
Navigate to https://example.com and test it on iPhone 13
```

**AI Executes:**
```javascript
await playwright_navigate({ url: "https://example.com" });
await playwright_resize({ device: "iPhone 13" });
```

### During Testing

**You:** _"The button looks too small"_

**AI Prompt:**
```
Can you switch to iPhone SE (smaller screen) and check if the button is still clickable?
```

### Quick Device Switch

**AI Prompt:**
```
Switch to Pixel 7
```
```
Try this on Galaxy S24 instead
```
```
Show me desktop view
```

Test at 1366x768 resolution
```

### Specific Use Cases

**AI Prompt:**
```
Test at small tablet size: 768x1024
```
```
Show me the mobile breakpoint: 375x667

Check if the grid layout changes correctly at each breakpoint.
```

### Form Testing Across Devices

**AI Prompt:**
```
Fill out the contact form on iPhone 13, then switch to iPad and verify 
the form data persists. Check if the form looks good on both devices.
```

### Navigation Testing

**AI Prompt:**
