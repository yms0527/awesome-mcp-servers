## [1.0.11] - 2025-12-11

### Added
- **Bearer Token Authentication**: Added `token` parameter to all API request methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) for Bearer token authentication
- **Custom Headers Support**: Added `headers` parameter to all API request methods for custom authentication and header management
- **Request Validation**: Added header value validation to ensure all headers are strings
- **Type Safety**: Added `BaseRequestArgs` and `RequestWithBodyArgs` TypeScript interfaces for better type safety
- **Helper Functions**: 
  - `buildHeaders()` - Centralized header building logic with token and custom header support
  - `validateHeaders()` - Validates header values are strings
  - Enhanced `parseJsonSafely()` - Improved JSON parsing with console warnings for debugging
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Added 12 new edge case tests covering header validation, token/header conflicts, and invalid inputs
- **Enhanced Documentation**: 
  - Updated `Supported-Tools.mdx` with authentication parameters for all API methods
  - Added authentication examples to `Examples.md` with Bearer token, Basic auth, and API key examples

### Changed
- **Code Quality**: Refactored duplicate header building logic into shared helper function
- **Error Handling**: Improved error messages for invalid header values
- **Warnings**: Added console warnings when both `token` and custom `Authorization` header are provided
- **JSON Parsing**: Enhanced parseJsonSafely with warning logs for better debugging

### Fixed
- **Authentication Issue**: Fixed missing authentication support for GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE requests (only POST had it previously)
- **Header Consistency**: Ensured consistent Content-Type header handling across POST, PUT, PATCH methods

### Technical Details
- All 154 tests passing (142 existing + 12 new edge case tests)
- Backward compatible: Existing API calls without token/headers continue to work
- Custom Authorization headers override token parameter when both are provided
- Header validation prevents runtime errors from invalid header types
