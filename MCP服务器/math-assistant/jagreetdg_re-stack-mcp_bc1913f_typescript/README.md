# 🚀 Re-Stack MCP Server – Bridging Stack Overflow & LLMs

## **Introduction**
**Re-Stack MCP Server** is a model communication protocol (MCP) server designed to integrate **Stack Overflow** into **LLM-based coding workflows** (Cursor, Windsurf, GPT, Claude, etc.) using the **Stack Exchange API**. It ensures developers have real-time access to the latest solutions while restoring Stack Overflow's crucial **feedback loop**.

## **Why This Matters?**
### 🔥 The Problem
1. **LLMs Have a Knowledge Cutoff** – They don't have live access to **new Stack Overflow content**, leading to outdated suggestions.
2. **The Stack Overflow Feedback Loop is Broken** – Before LLMs, developers would ask questions on Stack Overflow and contribute answers, helping build a global knowledge base. Now, many problems get solved **privately with AI**, **never getting documented**.

### 🚀 The Solution: Re-Stack MCP Server
**Re-Stack MCP Server** fixes this by:
✅ **Providing real-time Stack Overflow access** inside LLM-based coding environments  
✅ **Prompting users to post questions** when encountering undocumented issues  
✅ **Encouraging developers to contribute their solutions** after solving problems  
✅ **Fetching the latest answers** from Stack Overflow to **refine LLM responses dynamically**  

## **Installation & Usage**
### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js 18+ (ES2022 support required)
- Stack Exchange API Key (Required)
- Stack Apps Registration (Required for write access)

### **Setup**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jagreetdg/re-stack-mcp.git
cd re-stack-mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Stack Exchange API credentials

# Build the project
npm run build

# Start the server
npm start
```

### **Environment Variables**
```env
STACKEXCHANGE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
STACKEXCHANGE_API_KEY=your_api_key
STACKEXCHANGE_SCOPE=write_access,private_info
STACKEXCHANGE_REDIRECT_URI=https://stackexchange.com/oauth/login_success
```

## **Features & Tools**
The server provides several MCP tools for interacting with Stack Overflow:

### Read Operations
- **Questions**: Search, fetch, and filter questions
- **Answers**: Get answers for specific questions
- **Comments**: Fetch comments on posts
- **Tags**: Browse and search tags
- **Users**: Get user information

### Write Operations (Requires Authentication)
- **Questions**: Post new questions
- **Answers**: Submit answers to questions
- **Comments**: Add comments to posts
- **Posts**: Edit existing posts

## **Authentication**
The server supports Stack Exchange OAuth 2.0 authentication for write operations:

1. Register your application on [Stack Apps](https://stackapps.com/)
2. Create a Stack Apps post describing your application
3. Configure the OAuth credentials in your .env file
4. The server will handle the OAuth flow when write operations are requested

## **Development**
```bash
# Watch mode for development
npm run dev

# Run linting
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix

# Run tests
npm test
```
