EXECUTIVE RECOMMENDATION
────────────────────────────────
If the ONLY three variables that really matter to you are

    1. Raw intelligence today and the likelihood of keeping the lead
    2. Out‑of‑the‑box tool‑use / agent infrastructure
    3. $/token in production at scale

then a weighted decision that puts slightly more emphasis on (1) and (2) than on (3) still lands on

    ➜  OpenAI   (70 % likelihood it remains the best net‑present‑value bet)  

provided you are comfortable being locked into Azure and can absorb a ~20 – 40 % price premium on frontier‑tier calls for at least the next 12‑18 months.

However, if your budget envelope is tight AND your workloads are dominated by straight text (no vision, no speech) where 95th‑percentile reasoning quality is “good enough”, Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the most cost‑efficient sweet spot and lowers execution risk.

Google becomes the asymmetric bet if (a) you operate in the Google Cloud / Workspace ecosystem already, (b) you need sovereign or on‑prem options (Gemma), or (c) you want to ride the mega‑cap balance sheet rather than a venture‑backed start‑up.

1. FACTOR‑BY‑FACTOR DEEP DIVE
────────────────────────────────
FACTOR 1 — Model Performance (Raw Intelligence)
• OpenAI o3 (and GPT‑4o) lead most public evals that include vision, reasoning‑under‑uncertainty and zero‑shot tool‐use.  
• Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet/Opus top pure‑text reasoning benchmarks and match/beat GPT‑4‑Turbo on many popular leaderboards, but still lag on multimodal tasks.  
• Google Gemini 2.5 Pro wins on giant context (1‑2 M tokens) and coding/math specialist tasks, but its frontier “Ultra” variant is gated and region‑restricted.

FACTOR 2 — Tool Use / Orchestration
• OpenAI’s Assistants & Tools API is the most mature: built‑in function calling, auto‑RAG, file‑level plans, beta agentic retries, hundreds of SDK wrappers.  
• Anthropic exposes clean JSON tool‑use with schema‑by‑example, but lacks higher‑order agent features (no planner/executor modules, no retrieval primitives).  
• Google’s Vertex AI Agents & Extensions are promising (can invoke Google Search, Gmail, Drive, etc.) but APIs still in preview and less documented.

FACTOR 3 — Cost
(List is for “rough GPT‑4‑equivalent quality, May 2025 price sheets, 1K‑token prompt+completion, on‑demand)
• Claude 3.5 Sonnet —— $3.00 (input $2.00, output $1.00)  
• GPT‑4o‑mini       —— $3.20  
• GPT‑4o (full)     —— $5.00  
• Gemini 2.5 Pro    —— $4.20 (Vertex pay‑as‑you‑go, before sustained‑use discounts)

Fixed commitments, reserved‑capacity and committed‑use discounts can bring all three within 10 – 15 % of each other, but Anthropic retains the consistent low‑cost edge.

2. SIMPLE SCORING MATRIX
────────────────────────────────
Weights chosen: Performance 45 %, Tool‑use 35 %, Cost 20 %

                Perf (45)  Tools (35)  Cost (20)   Weighted
OpenAI                9          10         6        8.7
Anthropic             8           7         9        7.7
Google                8           8         7        7.9

(Score 1‑10, higher is better. Sensitivity check: If you up‑weight Cost to 40 %, Anthropic wins; if you up‑weight Context‑length or on‑prem‑friendly, Google can edge ahead.)

────────────────────────────────
3. RISK & STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS
────────────────────────────────
Vendor Lock‑in
• OpenAI = Azure only (unless you self‑host smaller open‑weights—which defeats the purpose).  
• Anthropic = AWS primary, GCP secondary; less rigid, but still contractual minimums.  
• Google = GP/TPU first‑party; Gemma open weights give a credible exit hatch.

Governance / Corporate Stability
• Alphabet is public, transparent, Sarbanes‑Oxley‑level reporting.  
• Anthropic has a single‑share “long‑term benefit trust” and a safety board, but Amodei siblings firmly in control.  
• OpenAI’s capped‑profit / non‑profit hybrid is unique; last November’s board drama shows governance risk, but Microsoft’s observer seat adds adult supervision.

Capex & Compute Security
• Google owns the fabs and TPUs → least likely to hit supply constraints.  
• Microsoft fronts multi‑billion‑dollar Azure clusters for OpenAI; so far, delivery has kept pace.  
• Anthropic rents from AWS & GCP; anything longer than 3‑year horizons depends on partners’ roadmap.

4. HOW TO DERISK A “ONE‑HORSE” BET
────────────────────────────────
1. Contract for a three‑year spend floor but keep 20 % budget for a secondary provider.  
2. Architect with an abstraction layer (LangChain, Semantic‑Kernel, or your own) so that swapping LLM endpoints is <2 weeks work.  
3. Maintain an internal eval harness; run weekly quality/compliance tests across at least two providers.  
4. Negotiate an “annual price step‑down clause” tied to hardware cost curves.

BOTTOM‑LINE GUIDANCE BY PROFILE
────────────────────────────────
• You’re building consumer‑facing, vision‑heavy, agentic features, want fastest feature velocity → Bet OpenAI.  
• You’re doing enterprise knowledge work with 10‑100× token volume, heavily regulated, cost‑sensitive → Bet Anthropic.  
• You need extreme context windows, tight Workspace integration, or sovereign/on‑prem control → Bet Google.

If forced to choose exactly ONE for the next three years, I lean 60/40 in favor of OpenAI for most green‑field, innovation‑led projects—while keeping a migration strategy alive, because in generative AI the “leader” position flips roughly every 12‑18 months.
