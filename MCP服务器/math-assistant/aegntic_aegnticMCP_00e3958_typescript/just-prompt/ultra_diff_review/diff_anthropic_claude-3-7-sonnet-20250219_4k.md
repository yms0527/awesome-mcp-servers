# Code Review

I've analyzed the changes made to the `list_models.py` file. The diff shows a complete refactoring of the file that organizes model listing functionality into separate functions for different AI providers.

## Key Changes

1. **Code Organization:** The code has been restructured from a series of commented blocks into organized functions for each AI provider.
2. **Function Implementation:** Each provider now has a dedicated function for listing their available models.
3. **DeepSeek API Key:** A hardcoded API key is now present in the DeepSeek function.
4. **Function Execution:** All functions are defined but commented out at the bottom of the file.

## Issues and Improvements

### 1. Hardcoded API Key
The `list_deepseek_models()` function contains a hardcoded API key: `"sk-ds-3f422175ff114212a42d7107c3efd1e4"`. This is a significant security risk as API keys should never be stored in source code.

### 2. Inconsistent Environment Variable Usage
Most functions use environment variables for API keys, but the DeepSeek function does not follow this pattern.

### 3. Error Handling
None of the functions include error handling for API failures, network issues, or missing API keys.

### 4. Import Organization
Import statements are scattered throughout the functions instead of being consolidated at the top of the file.

### 5. No Main Function
There's no main function or entrypoint that would allow users to select which model list they want to see.

## Issue Summary

| Issue | Solution | Risk Assessment |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| 🚨 Hardcoded API key in DeepSeek function | Replace with environment variable: `api_key=os.environ.get("DEEPSEEK_API_KEY")` | High - Security risk, potential unauthorized API usage and charges |
| ⚠️ No error handling | Add try/except blocks to handle API errors, network issues, and missing credentials | Medium - Code will fail without clear error messages |
| 🔧 Inconsistent environment variable usage | Standardize API key access across all providers | Low - Maintenance and consistency issue |
| 🔧 Scattered imports | Consolidate common imports at the top of the file | Low - Code organization issue |
| 💡 No main function or CLI | Add a main function with argument parsing to run specific provider functions | Low - Usability enhancement |
| 💡 Missing API key validation | Add checks to validate API keys are present before making API calls | Medium - Prevents unclear errors when keys are missing |

The most critical issue is the hardcoded API key which should be addressed immediately to prevent security risks.
