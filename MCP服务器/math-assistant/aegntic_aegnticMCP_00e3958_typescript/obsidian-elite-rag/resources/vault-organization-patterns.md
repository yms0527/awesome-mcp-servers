- [[Project Phase 1]] -> [[Project Phase 2]] -> [[Project Phase 3]]
- [[Book Chapter 1]] -> [[Book Chapter 2]] -> [[Book Chapter 3]]
```

### Metadata Linking
```
Pattern: Links with additional context
Implementation: Links with attributes or metadata
Examples:
- [[Machine Learning]]{source: "textbook", confidence: 0.9}
- [[React Tutorial]]{completed: "2024-01-15", difficulty: "intermediate"}
