# Open Strategy Partners (OSP) Marketing Tools for LLMs

![](https://badge.mcpx.dev?type=server 'MCP Server') 

A comprehensive suite of tools for technical marketing content creation, optimization, and product positioning based on [Open Strategy Partners](https://openstrategypartners.com)' proven methodologies. 

This software is based on the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://openstrategypartners.com/blog/the-model-context-protocol-unify-your-marketing-stack-with-ai/) and is can be used by any LLM client that supports the MCP. 

As of early February 2025, the LLM clients that support MCP include:
- [Claude desktop app](https://claude.ai/download) is the easiest to use for the less technical among us (and it is made by the inventors of the MCP).
- [Cursor IDE](https://www.cursor.com/) is very popular with our developer friends.
- [LibreChat](https://www.librechat.ai/) is an excellent open source AI/LLM interface app.
