# AWS Well-Architected Security Assessment Tool MCP Server

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/awslabs.well-architected-security-mcp-server.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/awslabs.well-architected-security-mcp-server/)

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides operational tools for monitoring and assessing AWS environments against the AWS Well-Architected Framework Security Pillar. This server enables AI assistants to help operations teams evaluate security posture, monitor compliance status, and optimize security costs while maintaining operational excellence according to the Well-Architected Framework.

## Features

- **Operational Security Monitoring**: Monitor status of AWS security services (GuardDuty, Security Hub, Inspector, IAM Access Analyzer) across your infrastructure
- **Security Operations Dashboard**: Retrieve and analyze security findings from AWS services for operational visibility
- **Compliance Operations**: Continuously assess security posture against Well-Architected Framework for operational compliance
- **Resource Operations**: Discover and monitor AWS resources across multiple services and regions for security operations
- **Cost-Effective Data Protection**: Monitor storage configuration for encryption compliance while optimizing security costs
- **Network Operations Security**: Verify network configuration for encryption compliance in operational environments
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Monitor compliance status of AWS resources against security standards for operational reporting
- **Security Operations Context**: Access stored security context data for operational analysis and trending

Operations teams can use the `CheckSecurityServices` tool to monitor if critical AWS security services are operational across their infrastructure. The `GetSecurityFindings` tool provides operational visibility into security findings, while `AnalyzeSecurityPosture` delivers comprehensive security operations reporting against the Well-Architected Framework. The `ExploreAwsResources` tool provides operational inventory capabilities across services and regions to ensure complete operational visibility and cost optimization of the AWS environment.

## Installation

```bash
# Install using uv
uv pip install awslabs.well-architected-security-mcp-server

# Or install using pip
pip install awslabs.well-architected-security-mcp-server
```

You can also run the MCP server directly from a local clone of the GitHub repository:

```bash
# Clone the awslabs repository
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/mcp.git

# Run the server directly using uv
uv --directory /path/to/well-architected-security-mcp-server/src/well-architected-security-mcp-server/awslabs/well_architected_security_mcp_server run server.py
```

## Usage Environments

The AWS Well-Architected Security Assessment Tool MCP Server is designed for operational use across the following environments:

- **Production Operations**: Monitor security posture and compliance status in production environments for operational excellence.
- **Compliance Operations**: Perform ongoing compliance monitoring and reporting for regulatory and internal requirements.
- **Security Operations Center (SOC)**: Integrate with SOC workflows for continuous security monitoring and incident response.
- **Cost Optimization**: Monitor security service costs and optimize security spending while maintaining compliance.
- **Operational Reporting**: Generate security operations reports and dashboards for stakeholders and management.

**Operational Considerations**:
- **Automated Remediation**: While the tool provides operational visibility, automated remediation should be implemented through separate operational workflows.
- **Monitoring Integration**: Designed for integration with existing monitoring and alerting systems for comprehensive operational coverage.

**Important Note on Security Data**: When connecting to any environment, especially production, always prevent accidental exposure of sensitive security information.

## Operational Deployment Considerations

      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Controls

The AWS Well-Architected Security Assessment Tool MCP Server includes security controls in your MCP client configuration to limit access to sensitive data:

### IAM Best Practices

We strongly recommend creating dedicated IAM roles with least-privilege permissions when using the AWS Well-Architected Security Assessment Tool MCP Server:

1. **Create a dedicated IAM role** specifically for security assessment operations
2. **Apply least-privilege permissions** by attaching only the necessary read-only policies
3. **Use scoped-down resource policies** whenever possible
4. **Apply a permission boundary** to limit the maximum permissions

For detailed example IAM policies tailored for security assessment use cases, see the AWS documentation for each security service being analyzed.
