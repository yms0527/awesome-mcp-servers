"""
load_mcp_tools: taking the tools which are exposed through MCP server and are an MCP object, and to transform it into a LangChain tool. So we can use in LangChain or LangGraph agent.
ClientSession: provides framework for Python app to act as MCP client. It's responsible to connect to MCP server to exchange messages, react to server requests and notifications through customizable callbacks. It's initialize method can make request to server to establish connection parameters according to MCP specification.
StdioServerParameters: Pydantic class which has fields of commands and args, which represent how the client to run MCP server, whether with Python, Node or Docker, etc.
stdio_client: client communicate with MCP server through transport of input and output. Read from standard in, and write to standard out.

"""
Motivation of combining LangGraph, LangChain and MCP:
LangGraph agent, with help of MCP client, is making request to MCP server, and execution of tool is in server side, which is decoupled from LangGraph application.
LangGraph app is responsible for orchestration, MCP server is responsible for execution of tools.
