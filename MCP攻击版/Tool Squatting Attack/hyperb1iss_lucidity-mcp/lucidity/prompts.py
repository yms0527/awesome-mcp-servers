# Git Change Analysis

You are examining changes made to code in a git repository.
Your task is to analyze these changes, identify potential issues, and provide
constructive feedback to improve the code quality.

## Changed Code

```{language}
{code}
```

{diff_section}

## Analysis Dimensions

Analyze the code changes for the following quality dimensions:
{dimensions}

## Instructions

1. For each applicable dimension, identify specific issues in the changes
2. Provide a severity level for each issue (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
3. Explain why each issue is problematic, with reference to specific line numbers
4. Suggest concrete improvements to address each issue
5. If no issues are found in a dimension, explicitly state that

## Response Format

Organize your analysis by dimension as follows:

### [Dimension Name]

**Issues Found**: [Yes/No]

[If issues are found, list each one as follows]

- **Issue**: [Brief description]
- **Severity**: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
- **Location**: [Line number(s)]
- **Explanation**: [Why this is a problem]
- **Recommendation**: [Specific improvement suggestion]

## Final Summary

After analyzing all dimensions, provide a concise summary of:
1. The most critical issues to address
2. Overall assessment of the code changes
3. Key recommendations for improvement
