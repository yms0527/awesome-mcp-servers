## Features
- Integration with Gemini AI for mathematical problem-solving
- Gmail integration for sending mathematical results
- Iterative problem-solving approach
- Support for various mathematical operations
- Automated email generation with mathematical results
- Secure Gmail authentication
- Multiple recipient support

## Server Requirements
1. MCP Server Setup:
   - Python 3.x environment

## Environment Setup
1. Create a `.env` file in the project root
2. Add your API keys:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   GMAIL_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   ```

## Server Setup
1. Install server dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install mcp numpy pandas matplotlib
   ```

2. Start the MCP server:
   ```bash
   python example2-3_gmail_server_2.py
   ```

## Available Tools

### Currently Implemented Tools

1. Mathematical Operations:
   - Basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
   - Advanced mathematical functions (exponential, logarithmic)
   - ASCII value calculations
   - String manipulation and conversion
   - Array operations
   - Prime number calculations
   - Factorial computations
   - Fibonacci sequence generation

2. Email Tools:
   - Single recipient email sending
   - Basic email formatting
   - Simple attachment handling
   - Basic error handling
   - Gmail authentication
   - Email queue management
   - Basic delivery status tracking

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install python-dotenv google-generativeai mcp google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client
   ```
3. Set up your environment variables as described above
4. Set up Gmail API credentials:
   - Go to Google Cloud Console
   - Create a new project
   - Enable Gmail API
   - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
   - Download the credentials file

## Usage
1. Start the MCP server (see Server Setup section)
2. Ensure the server is running and accessible
3. Run the client:
   ```bash
   python talk2mcp_math_gmail_client.py
   ```

## Server-Client Communication
1. Connection Protocol:
   - Client establishes connection with server
   - Authentication handshake
   - Tool list synchronization
   - Session initialization
   - Email service verification

2. Data Flow:
   - Client sends mathematical queries
   - Server processes requests
   - Results are formatted for email
   - Email queue is managed
   - Delivery status is tracked
   - Notifications are sent

3. Error Handling:
   - Connection retry mechanism
   - Session recovery
   - Email queue recovery
   - Rate limit handling
   - Resource cleanup

## Example Queries
1. Basic Mathematical Email:
```
Calculate the factorial of 10 and send the result to user@example.com with the subject "Factorial Calculation Result".
```

2. Complex Mathematical Analysis:
```
Find the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, calculate their sum, and send the detailed analysis to team@example.com with a graph attachment.
```

3. Multiple Operations with Formatting:
```
Calculate the roots of the quadratic equation x² + 5x + 6 = 0, format the solution in LaTeX, and send it to professor@example.com with proper mathematical notation.
```

4. Scheduled Mathematical Report:
```
Generate a report of prime numbers between 1 and 1000, create a histogram of their distribution, and schedule it to be sent to research@example.com tomorrow at 9:00 AM.
```

## How It Works
1. The client connects to the MCP server
2. It processes mathematical queries using the Gemini AI model
3. Results are formatted for email
4. The system uses an iterative approach to solve complex problems
5. Results are sent via Gmail to specified recipients

## Error Handling
The client includes robust error handling for:
- API timeouts
- Invalid inputs
- Connection issues
- Tool execution errors
- Gmail authentication and sending errors

## Security
- Uses OAuth 2.0 for Gmail authentication
- Secure storage of API keys and credentials
- Encrypted communication with Gmail API
