## 📋 Next Steps (Once Deployed)

1. ✅ Verify health endpoint: `curl https://agent-scraper-mcp.onrender.com/health`
2. ✅ Test MCP protocol (initialize + tools/list + tools/call)
3. ✅ Test REST API endpoints
4. ✅ Verify screenshot functionality works
5. ✅ Test rate limiting
6. ✅ Verify OpenAPI docs at /docs

## 🔧 Testing MCP Protocol

Once deployed, test with:

```bash
# Initialize
curl -X POST https://agent-scraper-mcp.onrender.com/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"1.0.0"}}}'

# List tools
curl -X POST https://agent-scraper-mcp.onrender.com/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}'

# Test scrape_url
curl -X POST https://agent-scraper-mcp.onrender.com/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"scrape_url","arguments":{"url":"https://example.com","format":"markdown"}}}'
